  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Nearer and nearer toward strange and
unexplored regions, higher and higher
sailed the Wonderful Elephant, borne along
by the great silken balloon. Harold and
Ione, the Prince and the little Princess slept
peacefully.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was midnight by the hands of the clock,
but the boundless aerial space through
which they sped was lighted by myriads
upon myriads of twinkling stars. On and still
on through diamond-specked space the Elephant
floated safely. Above, below, to right,
to left, and round about in all directions,
flashing, glittering globes of light were to be
seen and of such dazzling hues and colors as
had never been dreamed of by earth-bound
mortals. The planet Neptune was wrapped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>in a bluish-green vapor; Uranus seemed a
blinding white; Saturn emitted a yellow
light; Jupiter shone like a glorious, crimson
jewel; Mars blazed forth fiery red beams,
while Mercury seemed bathed in a metallic
green color.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our young travelers had watched these
silent orbs until from sheer exhaustion they
had fallen asleep. Suddenly, with a quick
jerk, the balloon came to a dead halt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy, what can be the matter!” said
Ione, springing up. “Do you suppose that
the balloon can’t carry us any higher?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure I don’t know,” answered Harold,
only half awake, “still it can’t be that,
for the old man said he had visited Mars and
several other planets. Something must be
out of order, however. Wait until I look in
his book of directions and find what ought
to be done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While Harold consulted the book, they all
waited in great suspense, for what would become
of them all should the balloon fail to
carry them on? Their anxiety was soon set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>at rest, however, for this is what Harold
found in the book:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The atmosphere extends some forty
miles above the earth, then an imaginary
line is reached beyond which the forces of
the earth cease to act; while the Sun, by its
great power of attraction, draws everything
toward it with irresistible force. If you
wish to cross this line and pass upward, use
extra pressure and inflate the balloon to its
utmost capacity. It will then carry you
across and you will find that you are attracted
toward the Sun, as before you were
attracted toward the earth. Steer for any
planet which you wish to visit and you can
safely land upon it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harold stopped reading there was
dead silence for a few minutes, then he said,
“Prince, will you kindly press that electric
button at your right? We can then watch
the balloon inflate and carry us over the
line.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Slowly but surely, with much creaking
and crackling of the silken cover, the balloon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>became fully inflated, while the little Princess
with strained, frightened eyes watched
through one of the peep-holes, in mortal terror
lest at each creak it might burst and they
be hurled to the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>No such thing happened, but instead, the
balloon gave a sudden bound and commenced
rising at an alarming rate of speed;
in fact, so fast were they approaching the
Moon that they feared they would dash
against one of its mountain tops. Harold
found on consulting their time-indicator
that they were traveling at a rate of speed
equal to that of a ray of light, which is one
hundred and sixty thousand miles per second.
And it takes light moving at that rate
of speed eight minutes and seven seconds to
reach the earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look, every one look!” cried Ione.
“What is that glistening, sparkling light
that seems to ripple and flow like a stream
of water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the Milky Way,” said Harold.
“From the earth it looks like millions upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>billions of stars sweeping a pathway
through the heavens, but now that we are
nearer, it seems like one continuous stream
of silver fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t it perfectly beautiful?” exclaimed
the girls in chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Looming up before them was what appeared
to be a large red island that floated
in the heavens as a pond lily floats upon the
surface of water. It seemed to get its color,
not from anything red upon the island itself,
but from red rays of light that fell directly
upon it from the planet Mars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Far in the distance floated other cloud-islands,
each bathed in a color corresponding
to the hue of the planet from which the
rays came. They afterward found that
these islands accompanied the different
planets in their orbits much as our Moon
does the earth. From the earth they have
the appearance of stars, not islands.</p>

<p class='c009'>Look in what direction one would, countless
flashing rainbow islands could be seen
whirling and twirling in fantastic manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>like giant spinning wheels, forming geometric
figures of every conceivable design as
they sped on their way, while through them
all, in imposing, majestic lines swept the
planets.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you say to our first visiting the
island of Mercury, that being the one nearest
the sun, and then taking the others in
order?” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all agreed to this plan.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, I am going to state a few astronomical
facts, dull as you may find them, for
they are things you all should know, and I
think the girls have little conception of the
millions of miles distant these planets are,
or of their size and the time it takes for light
from them to reach us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, just out of curiosity I am going to
ask you how large you think these planets
are which you look at every night, and how
far away they seem. I advise you to begin
your guessing about Venus, as it is best seen
from here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, let me see,” said Ione; “Venus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>looks to be about the size of a cheese, but, of
course, I know that in reality it is almost as
large as the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, princess, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks to me to be about the size of a
barrel-head and that it is twice as large as
the earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are both wrong, and to show you
how much you are in error, here are a few
figures. Mercury is thirty-six million miles
distant from the sun and it takes eighty-eight
days to make one revolution in its orbit
round the sun, consequently its year is
only eighty-eight days, instead of three hundred,
sixty-five and one quarter days as ours
is. Wouldn’t you like to live where the years
were that long? Then you could have four
Christmas Days where now you have but
one,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercury,” he continued, “has the shortest
year of all of the planets and Neptune
the longest, its year being sixty thousand,
one hundred and twenty-six days in length.
Just think, if you lived upon Neptune you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>would have a Christmas once in about nineteen
years reckoned by our time. The length
of year varies with the other planets—but
enough of statistics. I know they are uninteresting
to girls. How would it please you
to hurry on to Mercury’s Satellite Island to
see what it looks like and if it is inhabited?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure it is inhabited,” said the
Prince, who was looking through the telescope,
“for I can see tall figures moving
along its shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Faster and faster sailed the balloon, dragging
the Elephant after it until they were
within a minute’s distance from the island.
Bathed in beautiful clear, greenish-white atmosphere,
hundreds of people were standing
on the beach of the island, which is swept
by mighty currents of air even as our sea
shores are swept by the tides, and were
watching the approach of the queer-shaped,
clumsy object from an unknown world. A
little jolt and the Elephant’s feet touched
the shore.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>At first our young people kept still and
peered through the peep-holes to get a good
view of the strangers, but for some moments
few were to be seen, as most of their
number had darted away with lightning-like
speed when the Elephant landed. To attempt
to describe the swiftness with which
these people moved and the ease with which
they darted here, there and everywhere
would be difficult. No wonder that they
were quick, lively and elusive for they had
strange little wings on their caps and sandals,
such as you have seen on statues of the
winged Mercury. Tall and handsome with
beautiful foreheads and quick flashing eyes,
they fluttered and flew about like so many
birds.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Those who had disappeared soon returned
and approached the Elephant, for they
seemed fearless people after all, and then
our young travelers slipped into their new
white robes, which, by the way, I forgot to
tell you about. They had found them enclosed
in little jeweled acorns, which they
thought were only watch-charms, but accidentally
having touched a hidden spring in
one, it opened and out fell a robe. They were
fine as cobweb, soft as silk, changeable as the
colors of a soap bubble and had the wonderful
properties of making one invisible, giving
one any outward appearance one might
wish to assume, and at the same time enabling
one to understand any language
spoken within hearing. After donning these
magic garments they found they were
dressed like the little Mercurians, even to the
wings on their heads and feet. They also
found that they could understand all that
was said by these sprightly people, for their
language consisted entirely of short words
and abbreviations. You must remember that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>these people are always in a hurry so have
no time for long words or expressions.
When asked what their chief occupations
were, one of the inhabitants answered that
they consisted almost entirely in conveying
messages between the earth and the planets.
“We also watch over the people on earth
upon whom the rays of Mercury fell at the
moment of their birth. They possess the
nature and characteristics that the influence
of this planet is said to impart and so are
our especial proteges.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are some of these characteristics?”
said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When not afflicted; that is, when no ray
from an evil planet crosses the Mercurian
ray, Mercury gives one a quick, sprightly
manner, fluent speech, quick wit, bright intellect,
and fondness for change and travel.
These characteristics are greatly modified
when cross-rays intervene from evil planets,
and then one is unreliable, a busybody, has
a sharp unkind word or a sneer for every
one.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“Oh, my! I hope no bad ray crossed my
Mercurian ray at birth,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not fear,” answered one of the
island people; “you were born under a ray
from Venus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goodness! How do you know that?”
asked Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By your face. We planet people can
tell the moment we see a person what planet
or planets influenced at birth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you really?” asked Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Islander continued, “One of you give
me the year, month, day, and hour in which
you were born and I will tell you your nature,
disposition, abilities, and whether you
are destined to be healthy or unhealthy too,
and whether you will be what is termed
lucky or unlucky.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harold gave him his birth data and in return
was told that he was ambitious, venturesome,
loving, kind, thoughtful, quick-witted,
far-seeing, healthy, extremely lucky,
and very fond of travel.</p>

<p class='c009'>That Harold was all of this his companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>well knew, but how a perfect stranger
could tell by learning his date of birth and
barely looking at him was more than they
could at once understand. The stranger
finally told them that he did so by the science
called astrology, which all star-people believe
in, but which comparatively few people
on earth seriously study today. It was held
in great respect by the ancients, and even
less than a hundred years ago, during Napoleon’s
life, many believed in the science
and what it foretold for the future. Napoleon
and Henry of Navarre both believed in
what they called their lucky star and would
consult an astrologer before undertaking
any important venture to see whether or not
they would be successful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The self-appointed guide and informer of
our young friends, having learned something
of their history, became deeply interested
in the party and asked if they
would not like to visit the interior of the
island to see just how its inhabitants lived.
They gladly signified their pleasure to do so,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>and what was their joy to find that they
could fly over the ground with their artificial
wings quite as easily as the native Mercurians.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they sped along, many things were explained
to them concerning the various solar
systems and especially the one we call ours.
This they learned consists of the Sun, Moon,
Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, with accompanying
satellites, besides innumerable
fixed and moving stars; and ours is only one
of many solar systems.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of the things the guide pointed out
filled the party with awe and wonder. Reflected
on the clear blue vault above them
was a continuous moving panorama of everything
that was taking place upon the
earth beneath them. Time and space seemed
to be done away with. Did they wish to see
what was transpiring in any country, all
they had to do was to wish, and as if by
magic the picture was above them. Simply
by looking up they could see all they desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>reflected there; the country, its people, just
what they were all doing; the whole living
scene. As it happened a war was being
waged in Asia. They could see the approach
of the armies, could watch the progress of
the battle, could almost count the number
slain; and, still greater miracle, with the
wish to know the cause of any war or of any
event of past history, instantly came the
knowledge—all was made clear. The picture
of the present could be made to fade at
their will and that of the past to take its
place on the vault above them or to float by
on flying clouds panorama-like.</p>

<p class='c009'>When their surprise and amazement had
partially subsided the Prince said, “Well,
this is the most glorious way of learning history
that I ever heard of. If our schools on
earth could make moving pictures of the
leading events in history pass before the
children’s eyes, they would be able to remember
much better than by sitting and
committing to memory a lot of dry facts and
dates.” And all agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Just for fun, let us wish to see what
country we are over now,” said Ione, and
immediately they saw North America, the
particular spot being Chicago. They all
gazed with interest upon the City by the
Lake with its high buildings, and hurrying,
scurrying people. The cloud above floated
slowly along displaying different parts of
the city and its surrounding parks and
suburbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, let us see Siam and find out what
my brother is doing,” said the Prince, and
immediately Chicago with its hustle and
bustle faded from view and in its place stood
the beautiful white palace of Siam. Presently
was revealed to them the Prince sitting
in state in all his robes of splendor enjoying
his power to the utmost, for unlike
our Prince he was fond of pomp and splendor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us see a picture showing what became
of the Prince and Princess,” said Harold.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p>THEY FOUND THEM ENCLOSED IN LITTLE JEWELED ACORNS<br><br>(p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The next view presented the Elephant rising from the earth, drawn heavenward by a
huge balloon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, this beats any detective agency I
ever heard of,” said Harold. “You lose a
thing or it disappears and all you have to do
to find it is to wish to know where it is and
there a picture of the object and place appears
before you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you now ready to go on and see
something of our island?” said the guide
presently, who had been patiently waiting
for them to recover from their amazement
at all they saw.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly, and we beg your pardon for
keeping you waiting so long, but you can
have no idea how fascinating we have found
all these strange things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is that bright yellow light we see
surrounded by those smaller different colored
lights and luminous belt?” asked the
Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is the planet Saturn with its five
satellites and luminous belt, and do you see
floating under it, a little to the left, a dim,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>yellow light that looks like a reflection from
that same planet?” said the guide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” they answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is another island like the one we
are on now, only it is under the rays of Saturn,
as we are under the rays of Mercury.
It is also called the Island of Knowledge,
because the people of Saturn’s land are very
intellectual. Now that you are up here you
should visit all of our islands in turn and
see for yourself what they and their people
are like. First allow me to make a suggestion,”
continued the guide. “Leave your
heavy Elephant on our island, as you will
have no use for the balloon until you wish
to return to Earth. At present avail yourself
of our means of locomotion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A splendid suggestion!” they all exclaimed,
“But how can we with our heavy
bodies of flesh expect to fly around as you
people do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come with me and I will show you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The guide secured a pair of scales and
each one in turn having been weighed, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>found that no one exceeded five pounds in
weight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your scales must be wrong,” exclaimed
Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no, it is only because your bodies
become lighter in this atmosphere, though
they look the same as ever. Your magic
robes will bear you up while your wings are
carrying you from place to place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will have to take our Flying Machines
to reach many places at great distances
from here, or else a boat on the Milky
Way. I would advise you, after visiting all
of our planet islands, to take what is called
‘The Circle Trip.’ That is a trip in a beautiful
boat up the Milky Way, which encircles
the heavens like a belt. You are borne
along on its silvery waters in little shell-like
boats to whatever place you wish to visit
along its shores, for you must know that
both sides of the stream are lined with cities,
towns, villages, meadows, hills, and mountains,
where people live as Earth people do
beside their seas and rivers.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“How perfectly entrancing it would be to
visit all of the cities and islands you have up
here among the stars!” said Ione. “And
just think of it! we on Earth when looking at
the little twinkling stars above us imagine
them to be only bright, silvery balls of light,
and now we find them inhabited. Will wonders
ever cease?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not while you are up here,” said the
guide. “They will go on increasing until
you will feel as if your very brain would
crack in trying to grasp them all. Now, if
you don’t mind,” said he, presently, “we
will rise a hundred feet or so above the surface
here, then you can look down and view
our home from above as we fly over it on our
way to other islands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they floated along they noticed large
quick-silver mines and also those from
which emeralds and other green stones were
taken, besides large quarries of red marble.
The trees they passed were all short and had
but few leaves upon them, but there were
quantities of hazelnut bushes loaded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>nuts. All animals seemed to be fleet-footed,
quick in motion, and sly like the weasel, fox
and ape. The birds were not beautiful in
plumage but the exceptional sweetness of
their song rivaled that of our nightingale or
thrush.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Excuse me, but did you hear that peculiar
whistle?” asked the guide. “That is a
signal for me to go to Venus with a message.
Would you like to accompany me or would
you prefer to wait here? I will not say rest,
for no one is ever tired in this atmosphere
and it is only Earth people who understand
the meaning of the word tired.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, let us go by all means,” exclaimed
Harold. “That is, if it would not inconvenience
you, for you would show us the way
and we could be learning how to fly with
our new wings and robes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, mercy,” exclaimed the little Princess,
“I will be afraid to follow you from
this island out into space. Think of it!
Should my robe fail to hold me up I would
fall headlong as Lucifer did.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Don’t be afraid, my dear Princess. We
will stand on either side of you until you
gain confidence in yourself, besides you must
remember that you could not fall with this
magic robe about you and your wings will
move themselves. Of course, you could go
by simply wishing yourself there, but then
you would see nothing by the way, while,
by going in this way and more slowly, you
can enjoy all the marvelous sights about
you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the near distance they saw Venus, a
superb sapphire globe called the Planet of
Love and beyond it Mars with his fiery light;
then Saturn yellow as an orange; Jupiter all
crimson and purple, and farther still,
Uranus scintillating with a vivid white
light, while at an immeasurable distance
Neptune was wrapped in changing shades
of blue and green.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Earth party with their guide passed
quickly by the little vari-colored stars and
the larger ones which formed the different
constellations or groups of stars through
which they were traveling, such as the Great
Bear, the Pleiades, Leo, and others too numerous
to mention, until they came to the satellite
island belonging to Venus. Here they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>landed and mingled with the inhabitants,
first expressing the wish that they become
like the planet natives so they could go about
unnoticed. This wish their accommodating
robes immediately made possible and then
they stood dressed in loose flowing Greek
robes, with sandals on their feet and hair
dressed in a Psyche knot or in clustering
curls confined by golden bands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! how becoming that costume is to
you. You look like Venus herself come to
life,” exclaimed the Princess to Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I can return the compliment a
hundredfold,” answered Ione, “for I never
saw you look more lovely than you do now
with your dark loose ringlets held in place
by that band of gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She certainly does look lovely enough to
kiss,” exclaimed the Prince, “and I think I
will steal one, for who has a better right?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ione, you really look more beautiful
than you did when we were married, and
that I thought impossible,” laughed Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The boys had been so taken up admiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the girls that they had forgotten to wish
their clothes changed until Ione reminded
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hurry and change your costumes for I
am dying to see how you will appear in the
ancient Greek dress with bare neck, arms,
and legs and with your feet encased in high
laced sandals.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harold’s ordinary American
clothes were changed for those of ancient
Greece, Ione said, “Oh, Harold, you look
like a young gladiator with your well-developed
muscles and strong round throat.
As for the Prince he is a perfect Adonis.
Don’t you think so, Princess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the latter could answer their Mercurian
guide said, “You certainly are a fine-looking
quartette. I doubt if even on this
island we find any who surpass you in beauty
or in strength, though this is the land
where the perfection of physical beauty is
supposed to be found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We thank you for the compliment,” said
Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>This conversation took place in a beautiful
park where winding paths led to sylvan retreats;
where miniature lakes were studded
with pleasure-boats, sailing slowly along
filled with happy, laughing people; where
flowers of every hue and color filled the air
with sweet, spicy perfumes; and where birds
of endless variety and color of plumage
bathed in the sparkling fountains or flitted
and sang among the branches of the trees.
Coming toward them, hand in hand along
one of the many footpaths, were two beautiful
beings accompanied by little flying cupids
who at times lighted on their shoulders,
then again on their heads, or flew about
chasing each other, cooing like so many
white doves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is not that a pretty family group?”
asked the guide. “The two who are walking
hand in hand are husband and wife while
the little cupids are their children. All children
on this island have wings and at night
sleep in huge nodding flowers which fold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>their petals about them and sway to and fro
until they are lulled to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment the two approached and
the guide introduced them to the young
strangers. Having cordially welcomed the
Earth party to the island, they invited them
to a four o’clock tea at their home and also
for a sail on the lake to which they were now
on their way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our young people gladly availed themselves
of the courtesy extended to them and
after walking a short distance through a
shady wood they came to the bank of a
gleaming blue lake whose rippling waters
flashed back the sparkling sunbeams, and
on whose surface floated unique and dainty
pleasure-boats. Into one of these they
stepped and soon were sailing quietly
along, enjoying both the refreshing breezes
and the beauty of the scene. The shore line
was dotted with villas which looked like
fairy-palaces, so exquisite were they in coloring
and design, while back of them rose
purple-hued hills, a most effective background.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>While they sailed our young people
told their new friends something of
themselves and their experiences while traveling
in space. All was listened to with intense
interest. When they had finished telling
about the magic power of their wishing-robes,
their entertainers asked if they would
mind exhibiting themselves in their native
costumes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not,” said Ione, “we would be
delighted to do so, but our garments will
seem strange and perhaps even ridiculous to
you. If they do, you may laugh as much as
ever you like for I assure you we will not be
offended in the least.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“One, two, three. Presto change,” said
Harold, and there stood four oddly attired
people looking unlike anything their Venus
friends had ever seen or dreamed of. They
might have been mistaken for figures of wax
shown in a museum but that Ione laughed
outright when she saw the wide-open eyes
and astonished expressions on the faces of
their friends.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Well, how do you like our native garments?”
she asked. “You know that the
Prince and the Princess live on one continent
of the Earth, while Harold and I live
on another and that accounts for the differences
in our style of dress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Which style do you prefer?” asked the
Princess of the beautiful little lady from
Venus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, yours,” she replied. “Your attire
is much more artistic and natural than the
other more sombre garb. Your white
blouse, blue velvet jacket embroidered with
gold, soft silken sash, golden anklets, and
slippers turned up at the toes, all are harmonious
and beautiful I think, while the
white turban of the Prince and his white
skirts held in place by that knotted sash,
and the dagger at his side, all are more to my
taste than those queer-looking narrow bags
which you (turning to Harold) wear, and
which you call trousers or than that high,
stiff starched garment you call a shirt. How
you can breathe one minute in it is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>than I can tell, while I should think the collar
would saw your ears off.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this they all laughed for they could
well understand how funny and absurd their
costumes must look to any one used only to
loose robes and soft, clinging draperies. As
for Ione, the Islanders wondered why she
did not break in two, locked in her steel
girdle as they called her corsets. And her
French-heeled shoes! They were the limit
of absurdity and how she managed to walk
and not fall on her nose at every step she
took was more than they could understand.
The planet people had a great deal of fun
over each separate garment and seemed to
enjoy inspecting them so much that our
young friends decided to give them a surprise
and at the same time to show them
sights which no native of Venus, alive or
dead, had ever before witnessed. They were
told to look overhead and there soon appeared
reproduced there, panorama-like, the
different peoples of the earth. In this way
could be seen the native costumes of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Earth people from the Chinaman to the
fashionable French woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Venusians clapped their hands with
delight as the different views passed before
them for they had not known that there
were people who looked or dressed so unlike
themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>On their way to the Villa where they were
to take tea, the Venusians asked our friends
if they would not like to walk through the
garden where their little cupid babies slept,
while they looked to see that they were all
tucked in their flower-beds warm and safe
for the night. “Over each baby a white
pigeon keeps watch so that if anything is
wanted or if they cry out, the bird flies to
our window, taps, and we immediately come
to see what is needed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, may we have just one peep?” cried
the girls, as they leaned over a large white
rose in which was curled up fast asleep a
tiny little cupid with light, curly hair.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see,” explained the mother, “the
little blonde cupids sleep in white flowers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>while the brunettes repose in red ones. In
this way it is easy to distinguish them. Every
evening at sundown they fly to their particular
flower and cuddle down for the
night, while a gentle breeze sways the flowers
and nightingales sing until they are
lulled to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would I not give for one of the little
dimpled darlings,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I, too,” added the Princess. “I
should love to have one all my own to hug
and kiss.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Some day a stork or an angel may bring
you one,” said the little cupid’s mother,
“for I know they often take babies to
Earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Villa looked more like a dainty summer-house
than a place in which to live, for it
was all open windows, doors and verandas.
The sun shone in all day and only soft, warm
breezes murmured through it at night. After
a dainty repast, our travelers said “goodnight”
and “good-bye” to their charming
and hospitable friends and then wished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>themselves on the Satellite Island of Mars
and here they immediately found themselves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the soft blue atmosphere of Venus
Island, what a contrast was felt on Mars.
Here everything was fiery red, even the
faces of the inhabitants took on a flame color,
just as the people and scene in a theatre
are colored by a red spot-light thrown upon
the stage. But the coloring round about was
not as great a contrast as were the dispositions
of the people. The Martians, our
young friends soon discovered, were quick-tempered,
argumentative, impatient, and
quarrelsome; while the Venusians were mild,
sweet-tempered, easy-going, kind, affectionate,
and peace-loving. The Martians were
so fiery and cross that the little Princess
wanted to go away immediately, she was so
afraid of them. She was finally persuaded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to remain, however, for the Prince and Harold
were anxious to see what kind of firearms
these people used and, as they devoted
their whole lives to warfare, how well they
were versed in military affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Until now our young people had been invisible,
but they decided to don coats of
mail and otherwise costume themselves as
the Martians, so as to be able to freely mingle
with them unnoticed and unknown. On
every side one heard the clash of arms and
the rattle of musketry. Even the little children
could be seen playing at war with toy
cannons and pistols.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What can all this commotion be about?”
exclaimed Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It means that they are preparing for one
of their frequent battles, for you must know
that they are always quarreling or fighting
with some one. At present, they are at war
with the inhabitants who live on the opposite
side of this island. If you would like,
we can go to the summit of yonder hill and
from that point look down upon the contending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>parties, for the battle, I hear, is to
be fought on the plain at its foot,” said the
Prince. Disputes and national problems
are not settled here as they are on Earth.
When any vexed question arises, a certain
number of men are chosen on each side.
Drawn up in lines opposite and facing each
other, at a given signal the attack is made,
and the contending parties fight until one or
the other side is conquered. The victorious
men then arrange the disputed matter to
suit themselves. Neither side is allowed to
call out any more men than those first
chosen. This is a great saving of lives when
compared to the manner in which men are
sacrificed upon Earth in time of war.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then, stepping aside, Ione bumped
into a man who happened to be passing at
the time, and she heard him mutter,
“Clumsy! Can’t you look where you are going
so you won’t run into a person?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What a nice amiable husband that man
would make,” said Ione to the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently two men passed, talking in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>loud voices and one said, “I tell you it is no
such thing. You are an idiot for thinking
so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And his companion replied, “What did
you say? I’ll allow no man to insinuate that
I am a liar or to call me an idiot,” and before
the girls knew what was happening, the
man who had first spoken was lying at their
feet felled by a blow from his angry companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>This is only one instance of the quarreling
and fighting that they heard and saw on
all sides. Every one seemed touchy, cross,
overbearing and as if carrying a chip upon
his shoulder for the express purpose of having
some one knock it off and thus give
provocation for a dispute or fight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Ione,” called Harold, “we are
going to the top of the hill, for the battle is
about to begin. Did you hear the bugle
call?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, you bloodthirsty boy! How can you
wish to see men kill each other? You may
go; I do not wish to see the battle, and while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>you are there the Princess and I will wander
about to see how these people live and
what their homes are like,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls, by means of their magic wishing-robes, became invisible and found themselves
in front of one of the Martian homes
which at first sight appeared like a huge
bee-hive with openings at equal distances all
around. Through one of these openings an
electric wagon passed, loaded with packages,
boxes and cans. The labels showed the contents
to be condensed foods of all kinds.
They afterward found that these people
were partial to this kind of food because
they do away with the tedious preparation
and long time required to serve, which the
food of Earth people makes necessary, besides
they sustain life and make one much
stronger and healthier than the more hearty
meals which Earth mortals indulge in. Much
of the food that Earth people eat is a detriment
to digestion and health and is often
only eaten because of fondness for its taste
rather than for its nutritive properties, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>for the sociability it affords one to be at a
table dining with congenial friends or associates.
From the openings in the building,
covered passage-ways ended in small, two-storied
outhouses which were the co-operative
kitchens, laundries, dairies, cold-storage
rooms, etc., and over these the servants lived.
In the second story of the main building over
the openings before mentioned, were the
apartments of the Martians. Everything
on the island, from business to the care of
children, was carried on through co-operation.
They found the interior of the building
complete in all of its appointments and
furnished as elegantly as the most fastidious
lover of apartments could desire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I am not fond of apartments,
boarding-houses, hotels, or abodes of any
kind where several families live together.
As soon as different families share the same
building it loses its home-feeling and atmosphere,
while no dwelling is large enough to
hold more than one comfortably,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us now see how the battle is progressing,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>said the Princess. Ione was
finally persuaded and wishing themselves
on the summit of the hill, what was their
surprise and dismay on arriving there to
find no one in sight!</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you suppose can have become
of the boys?” cried the Princess in alarm,
then noticing Ione’s eyes fastened on the
battlefield in horrified wonder, she turned to
look in the same direction and nearly fainted
when she saw Harold and the Prince, each
engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter with
giant Martians, while all around were
strewn the bodies of the dead and dying; for
few of the many who had started out so valiantly
a few hours before survived the first
onslaught of the enemy.</p>

<p>COMING TOWARD THEM WERE TWO BEAUTIFUL BEINGS<br><br>(p. <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>While they watched, Harold caught his
foot, stumbled, then fell and the giant raised
his sword to pierce his body, but instead of
passing through the form of his adversary,
the sword was buried to its hilt in the earth
at his feet, for nobody was there. The giant
rubbed his eyes, looking dazed and incredulous, but still saw no one who even resembled
his late antagonist. I suppose you all know
why this was? Harold had just thought of
his magic robe and wished himself invisible
and at the top of the hill. He reached there
just in time to catch Ione in his arms for she
had fainted. The last thing she saw had
been the upraised arm of the Martian, and
the sun shining on the glittering sword as
it descended to put an end to Harold’s life.</p>

<p class='c009'>But the Prince! What had become of
him? Being an expert swordsman he had
killed his antagonist, a man twice his own
size and weight, but agility and swiftness
of thrust had won the day against size and
weight. His fencing lessons in the Palace
at home had served him in good stead. He,
too, now used his wishing robe and reached
Harold and the girls just as Ione was reviving
and asking how in the world they ever
reached the battlefield and got mixed up
with the Martians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, it happened in this way,” said the
Prince. “Harold and I became so excited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>watching the fight that we could scarcely
keep out of it and when we saw the side we
were in sympathy with losing ground, we
wished ourselves in the midst of the fray
with broadswords in our hands, so of course
the first thing we knew we were there fighting
like the native Martians. But where is
our guide?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure I do not know. We left him
with you,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I know, but the last I saw of him he
was standing beside us watching the battle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You don’t suppose that he too engaged
in the fight, do you?” asked the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if he did, where is he now, for all are
dead but the one man whom Harold failed
to kill,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goodness, gracious, he may be killed
too,” cried the Princess. “You had better
go and look for him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can find him better by staying here
than by running all over the island to find
him. Have you forgotten our ability to
have people and scenes pictured in the sky
above us?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Yes, I had,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now I wish that we may see where
he is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They all looked up and on the blue vault
above them saw the reflection of their guide
at the corner of a street, defending himself
against two burly Martians twice his size.
One glance was enough. Both boys disappeared
at once, their wish being to be with
the guide. The girls sat still and watched the
panoramic changes as the boys and their
guide joined in the fight. The trouble had
come about in this way: The Martians recognizing
the Mercurian guide by his quick,
agile movements and knowing that all Mercury
people had magic robes, had tried to
steal the acorn containing his wishing-robe.
When the boys arrived on the scene, the
Martians were soon routed.</p>

<p class='c009'>After this exciting escapade our party decided
that the strenuous life of Mars was
not to their liking, so together they resumed
their journey, starting for the next island in
order.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“Do you see that crimson ball in the distance?”
asked the guide. “That is Jupiter,
the planet whose Satellite Island we are now
about to visit and I am sure you will admire
its inhabitants very much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Such handsome people as these Jupitarians
proved to be! Far beyond their greatest
expectations. They were all tall and
commanding in appearance, with features
like chiselled marble so perfect were they in
outline. With their classic brows, straight
noses, and clear, luminous eyes they one and
all looked like gods and goddesses. Their
manners were dignified yet courteous in the
extreme, and in a way they impressed one as
being rather haughty and reserved.</p>

<p class='c009'>When our young people landed on the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>they found themselves in the middle of
a great square on three sides of which were
magnificent buildings dedicated to the arts
and sciences, over the colossal doorways of
which were symbolical mythological figures.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is an excellent idea to have them all
here together facing the square with its
fourth side opening into a beautiful park
containing fountains and marble statues,
also representing the gods and goddesses associated
with the arts and sciences as well as
those symbolical of the peaceful and just
natures of this island’s inhabitants,” said
Harold. “I imagine the building before us
with the broad, sweeping stairway must be
the Hall of Justice, for I see mythological
figures in marble over the doorway illustrating
Justice and Mercy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And the building on our right must be
their Palace of Art for it is embellished with
figures holding harps, flutes, horns, and
various musical instruments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose we keep on our invisible robes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>until we have made a tour of all these wonderful
buildings,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I suggest,” said the Princess, “that
Ione and I go to the Palace of Art while you
two boys go with Mercury, to listen to the
debates in the Hall of Justice, for I am sure
Ione and I will not care for the debates no
matter how fine they may be.” To this the
boys assented and all agreed to meet in two
hours’ time at the fountain where they were
now standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the girls first entered the Palace of
Art they had a surprise for they saw coming
toward them three beautiful smiling women
with hands outstretched to greet them. They
involuntarily stepped back, when they remembered,
all at once, that they were invisible,
and on looking closer they found
that the women were but wonderfully life-like
paintings.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well!” exclaimed Ione, “I never had
such a start in my life and even yet I can
scarcely believe my eyes for there is no
frame to mar the effect and the perspective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>is so perfect that you imagine they are living,
moving people coming to welcome you
to the Palace.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must have the boys come here so we
can fool them, too,” said the Princess. “I
have heard of portraits being so perfect
that they were called ‘living pictures,’ but
these paintings surpass any ever seen on the
Earth. Look! all around us are prancing
horses, wild animals devouring their prey,
and numberless pictures so realistic that I
am actually afraid I shall be trampled upon
or devoured. The babies, too, dimpled and
smiling are so life-like they make one feel
that they will roll off the canvas and get
hurt in some way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The pictures proved so fascinating to the
girls that they forgot how fast the time was
passing until they heard steps behind them
and, turning, saw that the boys had come to
look for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have been waiting for you and
thought perhaps you were lost,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“No, we did not get lost, but we were so
absorbed with the paintings that we forgot
all about time and our appointment with
you, but we are so glad you came for us for
we want you to meet three beautiful women
who welcome all strangers who enter this
building,” said Ione, winking at the Princess,
for though they were invisible to the
world at large, they could see each other at
all times.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, perhaps you have seen them already,”
said the Princess. “By which door
did you enter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We came through the passage-way that
leads from the Hall of Justice,” said the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then you did not meet them, so come
with us,” said the Princess. “But first drop
your magic robes and approach them in your
native costume.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls led the boys around until they
faced the picture and Ione was nearly suffocated
with laughter when she saw Harold
tip his hat and extend his hand to one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>ladies while the Prince bowed almost to the
ground. The Princess also laughed merrily
at the astonished expression on the faces of
the boys when they discovered their mistake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Later on Mercury said, “Before you leave
the island I want you to see the Palaces
these people live in and the superb way in
which they are furnished, to say nothing of
the magnificent grounds that surround
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You lead and we will gladly follow,”
said the young people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Talk of Aladdin’s Palace! It was a paperdoll’s
house compared to these enchanting
palaces built of snow-white marble and crystal.
Think of it! One palace was built of
emerald-colored, crystal-clear glass cut in
prisms joined in dainty designs to represent
flowers and leaves. Being cut in this manner,
no one could look in to get a peep at the
occupants; but the sunbeams found their
way throughout, the rooms and corridors reflecting
an exquisite golden-green light.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>This whole palace was held together by wide
bands of purest gold, which took the place
of our woodwork, while it was furnished
throughout with the corresponding magnificence
of its structure; for instance, one
drawing-room was furnished in white velvet
with jewel-set chair-frames of gold; another
in rare satin and velvet, while for pictures,
mirrors, and statuary, it had no equal
on Earth or any of the other planets, for the
Jupiter people love to a marked degree
splendor and magnificence.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were many of these rainbow palaces
all different in design, for it is against
the law for one to copy another in any way—from
matters of dress to those of homes and
furnishings, each must have an original design.
In this way there is an opportunity
for great display of taste and individuality
and one can tell at a glance from the
outside of a person’s home how rich the
owner is in ideas, for the buildings and surroundings
will reflect his nature and tastes.</p>

<p class='c009'>At the summit of a hill they saw a palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>shining so brightly in the sunlight that it
looked like the sun itself. It was built of
yellow topaz. Another of sapphire surrounded
by green foliage looked like a bluebell
hid in the woods, and so on until one
could not tell which he thought the most
magnificent or desirable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listen! I hear music!” exclaimed the
Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you hear,” said Mercury, “are the
church bells that ring at sunrise and at sunset.
Are they not the sweetest-toned chimes
you ever listened to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed they are,” replied the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the music of the bells had ceased,
Mercury told them it was time to start for
Saturn as it would take some time to reach
it even with their magic robes, as it was out
in space some seven hundred and eighty million
of miles away from the sun and they
were only part way there, Jupiter being but
four hundred and twenty-six million miles
distant from the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As we travel there, Harold will tell you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>what a surprise we have for you,” said the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, how nice, for if there is anything I
enjoy it is a surprise,” said the Princess.
“I hope it is a nice one, though,” she added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it is, or we would not tell you,”
said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do let’s hurry and get off, then,” said
Ione, “for I, too, am anxious to know what it
is. I am simply dying with curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never knew a girl to die so often and
come to life so easily,” said Harold in a
teasing voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suggest that we take hold of hands so
that we can keep close together,” said Mercury,
“if you people talk while we are travelling;
otherwise, some one will lag behind
and lose part of the story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His suggestion was followed and soon all
found themselves floating smoothly and rapidly
through space.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now for the surprise!” laughed Ione.
“I can’t wait patiently any longer. I am
not fond of waiting for things.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“In the first place, who do you think lives
on the island we are going to visit after we
take a look at Saturn? Some one in whom
you are interested?” queried Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, no one, you foolish boy,” said
Ione. “Why do you stop to tease me when
you know the Princess and I are all on tip
toe to know your surprise?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am not teasing this time,” said
Harold. “Guess just once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I can’t,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your father and mother,” said the
Princess, “or else Ione’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no relation to any of us, but a relative
to some one we are all indebted to for
most of the pleasant things that have ever
happened to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know! I know!” cried Ione. “Some
one who is related to our wise man, the one
who invented the Elephant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right, Ione. That was a good
guess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do tell us about him,” cried both girls
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“Well, it happened in this way. We were
sitting in the gallery in the Hall of Justice
when an old man got up to speak. He was
enough like our old man to be a twin brother,
(which he proved to be) and I cried out,
‘There is the wonderful old man who left me
the Elephant!’ Mercury said that could not
be as this old man had not left the island for
a century as he could not get away, being at
the head of the wise and learned men here
and President of the Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I can’t help it,’ I said. ‘If you don’t believe
me just look at this picture I carry
here in my watch and see if the man speaking
is not its exact counterpart even to hair,
eyes, and beard; besides, the voice is exactly
the same.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercury looked and said, ‘The picture
is certainly a perfect likeness of the man on
the platform.’ Then he told me to sit still
and when the session was over we would go
and speak to him and find out if he were
really the one who left the Elephant, or if
he were a relative of the man.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“This we did and the old man met us very
graciously and told us that he was a twin
brother to our old man. ‘And a wonderful
old fellow he is,’ continued the sage. ‘I
never saw his equal in inventive genius. He
originates things and then goes to the earth
to try them. His hobby is electricity and
finding out the secrets of nature, while mine
is to bring peace and administer justice, as
well as to promote the arts and sciences. I
never go to the earth but remain here and
plan, sending my deputies to carry out my
ideas.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘In speaking,’ said I, ‘you said is instead
of <i>was</i>, do you mean to tell me that
your brother and my wonderful old man is
alive still?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Certainly, I do. You thought he was
dead when he fell back on his pillow, but he
had merely fainted and after a time when
he recovered his senses he found himself, so
he said, on a bed of spruce bows, shut in a
cave. He knew immediately what had happened
and that you had buried him, thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>him dead, so he lay still for a time until
the coolness of the cave revived him, then
having his wishing-robe with him, he wished
himself back on his beloved planet Uranus,
and there he is now, safe and well. If your
travels take you that distance, to that most
wonderful planet which all inventors love,
you will find him there and I am sure he will
be delighted to see you all.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, what do you think of that for a surprise?”
asked Harold when he had finished
his story.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It certainly is a pleasant one,” said Ione,
“and of course we will go to Uranus, no matter
how far it is. I would not miss it for
worlds, would you, Princess?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither would we,” cried the boys, “and
we will go there as soon as we have seen Saturn.
We may remain on Saturn for some
time though, for they say it is different from
the other planets and that there is more
change and variety there than on the other
planets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is that?” cried Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“Well, you see it has different colored
belts on its surface corresponding to our
zones, and a luminous flat ring that surrounds
or encircles it about where the equator
does the earth, besides it has satellites
that belong to it as the Moon belongs to your
Earth,” said Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who knows but that different colored
races of people live on those different
belts?” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I say, let’s go and find out,” said the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Agreed,” they all said and, wishing
themselves on Saturn, our travelers found
themselves on the island itself instead of its
accompanying Satellite Island, for it seemed
to hold out so many inducements in the way
of its belted surface, rings, and seven satellites.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Our young people landed on the bank of
what appeared to be a broad river; so broad
that one could just discern the opposite
bank by a faint, blue line. Along this river
stretched house after house of peculiar design,
none more than one story high and
each and every one extending over so much
ground that it gave the appearance of a little
village connected by long and short halls.
The inside they found to be furnished with
only useful things—stiff, unhomelike furniture,
and no upholstered or rocking chairs
so dear to the American heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What, homely, sour-looking faces they
have, and long noses, thin lips, scant hair
and small suspicious-looking eyes,” said
Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I really don’t feel like stopping here, I
feel so depressed, and everything looks so
uninviting,” said the little Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury explained that Saturnian people
were strict disciplinarians and also very conventional;
and that they did not believe in
allowing the young to sit in easy chairs for
this encouraged a lounging, lazy habit most
unbecoming.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our young people pitied the children who
lived here. They had to sit erect in stiff-backed
chairs so as to counteract the tendency
which all Saturn children have to
stoop or lean forward. They also are compelled
to go from one task to another with
clock-like regularity while even their games
are governed by rule or stated hours which
seemed to take all interest and freedom out
of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid I should want to drown myself
in the river if I had to live here and endure
this tread-mill existence,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The walls of most rooms in the houses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>were lined with rows upon rows of books.
There were schools and schools and schools;
while lessons and lessons and lessons were being
studied everywhere, recitations being presided
over by tall, lank-looking, stoop-shouldered
professors with straight, black hair,
spectacled eyes, and stern visages. This constant
study and grind made the children
look older than their years warranted, while
their heads were all too large to be supported
by their poor, thin, shrunken-looking little
bodies. Most children begin their studies at
three years of age on this island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have seen enough. Have you, Princess?”
said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and more than enough,” answered
she.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury now mentioned that there was a
most interesting, novel part of the island
called “the Black Belt,” which received this
name from the color of the ring which encircles
Saturn at this part. There are seven
openings into this region called “The Gates
of Hades.” These openings resemble the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>mouths of caves from which red lights shine,
reflected from the inner fires.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you wish to visit the interior of this
planet, now is your opportunity,” said Mercury.
“A guide will be sent with us and will
insure our safe return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Of course the boys were wild for this adventure
but the girls were afraid to go until
assured over and over again that there was
absolutely no danger and that they could return
whenever they wished. So at last they
started in a most curious air-ship built like
a bird which was named “The Sky Lark.”
It could be made to fly as a bird and to alight
or to arise in the air with equal ease. They
all enjoyed the ride immensely, especially
when they would alight on some huge tree
which looked like the Banyan tree of Asia.
Travelling in the air gave them a splendid
chance to see all beneath them and the island
looked very beautiful from this height
because of its numberless bodies of water
sparkling in the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Who invented this novel bird?” asked
Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The most wonderful and experienced inventor
that now lives,” said Mercury. “He
is centuries old but by the aid of a magic
liquid he keeps himself alive and he is always
inventing or harnessing nature’s
forces to do his bidding until there is no telling
when he will stop. One of the most
unique things he ever invented was an artificial
elephant so like life that even live
elephants themselves were deceived and
thought it alive like themselves. This elephant
could travel on land, in the water or
on its surface, with the speed of the wind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stop, stop!” cried Harold. “What became
of that elephant and its inventor?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” resumed the guide, “he took a notion
to go to Earth, taking the elephant
with him and I have never heard what he afterwards
did with it, but he is back again at
his beloved laboratory on Uranus working
incessantly on another invention that will astonish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the universe, so he says, when he completes
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what is it to be?” cried the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Another air-ship, but of such large proportions
and ease of handling that few people
can even imagine anything as perfect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure you would like to know what
became of the elephant he took to the
Earth,” said Harold, “and I will tell you.
That elephant belongs to me and it is now on
the Mercurian Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” exclaimed the guide, “You own
the elephant and it is now on the Mercurian
Island?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But will you kindly tell me how you
ever got a big heavy thing like that up in
Star-land?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly. The balloon carried it up.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Balloon! Who ever heard of a balloon in
connection with an elephant? I never did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, there was one and a very good one
at that,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you, of course, but if any one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>else had told me that a balloon could be
strong enough to carry an elephant that size
I would not have believed it possible, but I
can believe anything any one tells me about
what that wonderful old man can do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They had now arrived at one of the gates
of Hades.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now let us start down through this first
gate, make a tour of the interior and come
out at the seventh gate,” suggested the
guide.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just then a burst of flames and the suffocating
fumes of sulphur poured out of one
of the caves near by and nearly choked them.
This settled the girls. They decided to remain
where they were.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate to have you go down, dear,” said
the Princess; “the fumes may suffocate
you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no,” said the new guide who had
arrived, “those fumes only arise when the
fires are being replenished. These holes are
like chimneys and no one can be entirely
overcome. Attendants take good care of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>that for they are instructed to prolong the
sufferings of their victims but not to kill
them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What relentless, cruel people these long-faced,
sly-looking Saturnians are,” exclaimed
Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boys disappeared through the opening,
the girls called after them, “Do be careful
and hurry back.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Down and down they went, choking and
coughing the while as they penetrated farther
and deeper into the very bowels of the
planet. The air grew hotter and hotter and
peering over the narrow, winding stairway,
they could see at the extreme bottom a red
hot mass of seething, burning matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hark! I thought I heard the Princess
scream,” said the Prince, abruptly stopping
on his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I heard no one,” said Harold, “so I
guess you are mistaken, or it might have
been the voice of some one down below.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps so,” replied the Prince; but
love’s ears are sharp, and he had heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>aright, though he was overpersuaded and
continued on his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Princess had screamed because directly
in front of her the ground had suddenly
opened like a big door and out of the
opening had come a red-clad figure with
horns on its head and a staff in its hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ione was too astonished to move and sat
there staring at the newcomer, with eyes and
mouth wide open. Bitterly she repented her
suggestion, which both girls had acted upon,
that they remove their magic robes and appear
once more to each other as the American
girl and the little Oriental Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have come for you,” said he. Neither
girl moved an inch.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come,” he continued, “or I shall have
to carry you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Still neither girl moved or knew what to
do. Stiff with fright, they vaguely wondered
what he would do if they refused to go with
him.</p>

<p>THE GIANT RAISED HIS SWORD<br><br>(p. <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>They soon found out, for he struck the
ground three times with his tail which rattled like that of a great rattlesnake and immediately
the ground opened as it had before
and out jumped a figure in scales of
green. He gave Ione one look, and then at
a signal from the other lifted her in his arms
which were as strong as iron and followed
the red sprite, who had picked up the Princess.
It was no use to struggle, thought the
girls, and maybe the boys had sent for them,
anyway they decided not to do anything until
they found what was going to be done
with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two sprites approached a large, flat,
white stone and both stepped upon it at the
same instant. Down it went, taking them
with it into the very center of the planet.
Not a word was spoken while they were slipping
through the long, dark shaft, and the
stone platform on which they were standing
stopped after a time, while a door at one end
of the shaft opened and they found themselves
in Hades, proper, as this portion of
it was called.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girls blinked like bats at first when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the vivid light flashed into their eyes but
they soon became accustomed to it. They
were now put into wheelbarrows that looked
as if used for carrying coal, and were
wheeled along without a word. The Princess
found a chance to whisper, “Do you think
they are going to burn us as they would
coal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure I don’t know. Oh, for our
magic robes!” said Ione in a similar whisper.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently they began to pass dismal cells
in which were chained wicked-looking men
and women, and over each of these cells was
an account of the deeds each had committed,
cut in letters which gleamed like coals of
fire. All around them blue, yellow, and
green devils were working, stirring the already
hot fires, throwing on more sulphur
or adding fuel, refusing ever to give the
poor inmates the cool draught of water for
which they were continuously begging.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over one of the cells they read the account
of a most brutal murder, over another the inhuman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>treatment of wife and children, and
so on past hundreds and hundreds of cells
until they were sick at heart to know that
such cruelties could exist and had to be in
some way punished. Of course they could
not but hear the moans and groans of the
victims and their horrible language as well,
but deaf ears were turned to all pleadings
and the girls felt that it would be useless for
them to beg to be taken back to the surface
and daylight and were beginning to lose
their courage, when to their surprise and
delight they saw Harold and the Prince
coming down a broad passage just ahead of
them. What then was the astonishment of
the boys to see them being trundled in wheelbarrows
down in the very depths of Hades?</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you mean by bringing these
ladies down here?” said the boys’ guide to
the sprites who had carried away the girls.</p>

<p class='c009'>They explained that they had been told to
bring down two people whom they would
find in a certain place, and as the girls were
in this place they of course brought them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>down. With many and profuse apologies
for their mistake, made in a language not
one word of which the girls could understand,
these sprites retired.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guides now asked them if they would
like to investigate further for there were
numerous divisions to Hades which they had
not as yet seen. These divisions were graded
according to the atrocity of the deeds committed.
The most wicked criminals were
sent to the lowest depths, the punishments
there being the most severe, while they lessened
as each higher division was reached.
The boys declared they had seen all they
cared to and as for the girls, they had witnessed
much more than they wished to, so
they were quickly conducted to the open
air.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is the very way we were taken
down,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sure enough, it is,” replied the Princess.
“Did you ever see such an elevator in
all your life?” for with a one, two, three,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>they had reached the open air, while just
before them fluttered their air-ship.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now where shall I take you?” asked
their attendant, “I have orders to show you
the sights of our island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank you, but we must not tarry
longer,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But surely you will like to visit our satellites
and luminous belts which we are very
proud of since ours is the only planet in this
solar system that has luminous belts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure they must be worth seeing, but
we have already stayed so long that we must
hurry on now,” said the Prince and, thanking
the guide for his courtesy and kindness,
they quickly donned their wishing-robes and
started for Uranus, glad to leave the gloom
of Saturn and relieved to get away from a
place where they had not heard one merry
laugh.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Off, off into space sped our quartette with
their guide, past heaven’s many-colored
star-lamps shining in their vault of blue to
light the many worlds that surround as well
as our world beneath them. They neither
loitered nor stopped at any place on their
way for you must remember that they had
to travel many million miles to reach
Uranus, that planet being way out in space
at a distance of from one billion, six hundred
and ninety-nine million to one billion,
eight hundred and sixty-five million miles
from the Sun. It takes this planet about
eighty-four years, traveling in its regular
path, to make one complete circuit of the
Sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without their magic robes it would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>been impossible to reach this distant island,
but with them, and by constantly reiterating
their wish to be there, they at last came in
sight of this glorious planet and were dazzled
by its clear white light which gleamed
and flashed with the brilliancy of the purest
diamond.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well that we are going to the Satellite
Island instead of to the planet itself,”
said Ione. “I doubt if we could endure its
dazzling light for it hurts my eyes even at
this distance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Strange, eccentric people live there,”
said Mercury. “People who on Earth would
be thought foolish or insane, for nothing is
too strange for them to tolerate, to investigate,
or to experiment with, and they are
constantly proving that what Earth people
sometimes look upon as impossible or
merely as the idea of a diseased brain often
proves both possible and practical, while the
so-called lunatic, the inventor, is here revered
as a man of brains and a genius.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The buzz of wheels and drills accompanied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>with the pounding of hammers was
heard on all sides, for everywhere men were
working on newly-invented, highly-perfected
air-ships, steamers, war-vessels, air
brakes, railroad apparatus of all kinds, machinery
for hoisting great weights, etc.;
while inside the buildings men were busy
in laboratories, bending over retorts in
which boiling liquids could be seen. These
men were so quaintly dressed and so weird-looking
that they reminded one of the alchemists
of old trying to turn the baser metals
into gold. There were wide-awake young
men here also, studying the marvelous properties
of the newly-discovered radium,
which at the present time is worth three
hundred thousand times its own weight in
gold, and many elements and metals that
Earth people know nothing of.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they went from shipyard to laboratory
and from laboratory to electrical workrooms,
they closely scanned the faces of all
about them, hoping to see their wonderful
old man. After leaving the men’s quarters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>they came to an immense building where
none but women were at work, some on
tapestries, others on lace that rivaled the
cobweb for delicacy of texture. Embroideries
they saw in which the flowers literally
seemed to grow, blossom, and wait to be
plucked; pictures done in illuminated paints
whose tints rivaled those of sunset skies—in
fact everything that human hands could
do was done here to perfection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our old man cannot be here,” said the
Princess. “Perhaps he has returned to
Earth with another elephant or air-ship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were about to abandon their search
for him when Mercury said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“See that peculiar looking edifice built in
the shape of a Greek cross. Let us go and
find out what it is. Perhaps it is the especial
laboratory of the very man for whom
we are searching.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On arriving at the door they were very
much impressed with the beauty and grandeur
of the entrance to say nothing of the
elaborate decorations of the edifice itself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The doors were wide open and, entering,
they saw in the center of a highly-vaulted
chamber, a large model air-ship that looked
as light as paper wrought in graceful curves
with great beauty of design, but which
proved to be on closer inspection as strong
as iron. That it would work like magic
without hitch or flaw, our young people
knew at once, since their wonderful old man
was its inventor. And there beside it he
stood with a dreamy, far-away expression
in his eyes as if he already felt himself
speeding through space in it. Harold recognized
him at once with his white hair and
beard and his loose gown of dark purple
corded in at the waist. They all advanced a
little nearer and stood directly before him
where his eyes would rest upon them immediately
he came out of his open-eyed dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury told the young people to doff
their magic robes, and they were scarcely off
their shoulders when the old man started,
rubbed his eyes, stared, again rubbed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>eyes as if brushing away some illusion,
looked once more, and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be ye flesh and blood I look upon or only
fancies of my brain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My dear sir,” Harold answered, “we are
flesh and blood and if you will but look more
closely you will surely recognize me as the
young man who entered your elephant when
I thought you dying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure! To be sure!” he exclaimed.
“But how did you all reach this island?” he
asked in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Harold had finished giving him a
detailed account of all he had done and
where they had traveled since receiving the
elephant, he said, “Well done, my young
hero. I see that my elephant could not have
fallen into better hands and from my heart
I am glad that you have all enjoyed it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much we have enjoyed and appreciated
your gift we will never be able to
tell,” replied Harold, “but we all tender you
sincere and earnest thanks,” in which the
rest of the party enthusiastically acquiesced.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“And now since you have come all this
way to thank me for my gift I will give you
another treat. I will take you all for a trip
in my newly perfected air-ship of which the
one before you is but the model. The ship
itself is in a large enclosure on the other side
of the building.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How perfectly enchanting that will be!”
exclaimed the girls, while the boys thanked
him profusely for all the trouble he was
taking.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No trouble, I assure you,” he said, “only
a pleasure. Follow me and I will show that
my air-ship is as far ahead of the elephant
as a fast ocean steamer is ahead of a flatboat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My! what are those people doing who
are jumping up in the air and darting about
as if shot from a gun?” asked the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure! To be sure! It must seem
strange to you,” answered the old man, “but
that is our mode of locomotion. We propel
ourselves through the air instead of walking,
as that is too slow to suit our tastes. We do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>not fly but we use an electric apparatus
about the size of a matchbox which we fasten
between our shoulders, and one half as
large which we wear under the soles of our
feet. If we wish to travel in the air to avoid
crowds and hindrances we simply press
hard upon the soles of our feet and the little
contrivances fastened there send us up almost
as rapidly as if blown by an explosive,
then by the use of handles connected with
the boxes between our shoulders, we propel
ourselves forward, backward, sideways or in
any direction desired. A great many of our
people devote all their time to studying new
and improved methods of travel for the use
of the inhabitants of Earth, for year by year
your people seem to be more and more in a
hurry and methods which seem perfectly
satisfactory one year are all too slow before
twelve months have passed by. Well!
here we are,” he continued, throwing
open enormous doors which led into a large
grassy enclosure devoid of trees of any description,
in which, pulling at her anchor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with every passing breeze, rested the air-ship,
“Queen of the Heavens,” as she had
been named.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall not attempt to describe this beautiful,
graceful, convenient marvel but will
leave it to the reader’s imagination. I will
say, however, that the heaviest metal used in
its construction was aluminum, while it was
lighted with radium whose dazzling glare
was softened by colored globes, and its propelling
power was electricity but so perfected
that an Earth-born mortal of today
would not recognize it as such.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, my dear young people, where shall
I take you for a sail? Shall it be to the
Moon, to the Dog Star, or still further
toward Neptune, or would you like to slowly
drop to within a mile of the Earth and then
sail around it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! the last!” they all exclaimed in
chorus, “for it would be such fun to see the
people of Earth gazing at us through telescopes
thinking we were inhabitants from
Mars coming to visit them.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“Very well, just as you choose,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>After they were comfortably seated, the
anchor raised and the old man had placed
himself at the helm, the ship began slowly to
ascend into the blue ether until it was above
and free from the high wall of the enclosure,
then with a turn of the steerage apparatus,
the huge ship glided up as easily as a bird
and with slightly lowered bow commenced
to sink toward Earth. Past single stars,
through groups of stars, still lower down
into starless ether, then across the air
line boundary into Earth’s atmosphere,
through thick masses of clouds, they at last
came into clear atmosphere half a mile above
the earth and could now see numberless people
straining their eyes to discover what this
strange aerial craft might be. It would take
an endless time to relate all that happened
on this trip but I will disclose a few events
in the next chapter of the voyage of “The
Queen of Heaven.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The big ship was poised in mid-air over
the Palisades of the Hudson, near New York
City. Presently the old man lowered the
machine so close to Earth that Harold and
the Prince descended a rope ladder and
landed in order that they might get some
newspapers and discover what was being
said about the air-ship, which had evidently
been seen at different places all the way
from California to the East. They were
likewise charged with several commissions
from the girls, not the least being one to
bring them candy for, as they said, “they
were dying for some of Huyler’s best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At about sundown the boys returned, having
made good time to and from the city.
Their arms and pockets were loaded with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>boxes and packages of various sizes, for they
had purchased candy, peanuts, gum, papers,
magazines, and last but not least a dress for
each of the girls which they knew would be
needed if they decided to land anywhere.
Those they already had were badly out of
style and, sad as it may seem, I shall have to
tell you that their magic robes would not
work below the air-shed line in the Earth’s
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boys were unloading their arms
and emptying their pockets, the girls stood
close beside them listening to the doings of
the day and eating peanuts and candy between
questions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! I will tell you the things that impressed
me most forcibly were the dirt and
the smoky atmosphere and, what was
scarcely less disagreeable, the unmannerly
people in the slow-moving crowds. I constantly
wished for my magic robe that I
might escape from the clanging bells, rumbling
wheels, and pushing crowds. It was
positively deafening after enjoying the quiet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>and peace of the skies, and suffocating too,
with its smoke-laden atmosphere. How so
many people can live in a city from choice,
I cannot imagine. I always disliked noise
and dirt but now after our recent experiences
in the heavens, it will be unendurable.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While they had been talking, the old man
had quietly steered the ship over New York
harbor and now he and Mercury were watching
a large white object that was sailing directly
beneath them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look over the side,” said Mercury. “See
what a beautiful sight the harbor presents
with all its ocean-liners and ferry boats moving
to and fro in the moonlight with their
many-colored lanterns. That fast ocean
greyhound is especially majestic and has
just entered the harbor with its hundreds
of passengers from foreign shores.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old man lowered the ship so that they
could distinguish voices on the steamer beneath
them and could see by the rays thrown
from the search-light the frightened faces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of the passengers. As the steamer passed
on to her dock the air-ship slowly ascended
until she was lost to sight in the clear night
sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>While they were speeding on their way to
Europe, Harold took out the papers he had
bought, and seating himself beside a shaded
reading lamp commenced to read aloud what
was being said about their air-ship. One
paper had in red head lines:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our neighbors from Mars have at last
materialized, but either from fright or some
unknown reason have failed to land or in
any way communicate with us, so that we are
none the wiser for their visit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Another read, “A wonderful phenomenon
has been observed at many points in the
West. First at San Francisco, then, within
twenty-four hours, in Omaha, later in Chicago,
and last in Philadelphia. It is impossible
to conjecture whether it is a heavenly
body wandering out of its natural course or
whether it is a mechanical toy invented by
human hands, for it travels too fast for satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>examination or observation. It is
at present reading an unsolved problem.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A scientific magazine devoted several
pages to theories concerning this aerial
stranger:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Its speed seemed only rivaled by the ease
and grace of its motions. It has not been
seen to land any passengers, neither is it
known that it contained passengers, although
judging from its direct and steady
course it is reasonable to believe that it
is controlled by human agency. People
are sleeping on the house-tops hoping to see
it sail by, for some one is on watch every
moment to give the signal should it appear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the meantime our young people were
half way to Europe in the midst of a terrible
thunder storm and now it was that “The
Queen” showed the perfection of her mechanism,
for with sails lowered, and all things
shipshape, she was ready for anything, and
though the wind blew hurricanes, the thunder
sounded with deafening crashes, and
the lightning fairly blinded them with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>lurid glare, the ship floated serenely onward.
Storms had no visible effect upon this queer-shaped
air craft. It shot through the storm
clouds like a meteor with no trouble whatsoever,
while the rain and hail slipped off doing
no damage. Once or twice the girls had
a scare when it turned bottom side up and
over and over two or three times like a
bucket of water when twirled at arms length,
but it righted itself at once and all was done
so quickly that not even a dish fell from the
shelves or a chair moved from its place any
more than a drop of water would fall from
a bucket swung in that way. At another
time it spun round and round like a top until
they were all dizzy and could scarcely sit
up, then it shot forward hither and thither
with lightning-like speed. At last the old
man disentangled the wires and adjusted
the steering apparatus, when all was again
smooth sailing, but he found that in doing
so he had sustained several shocks from the
electric wires and some bad burns.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now is the time for me to experiment on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>myself and see what radium will do for me.
It is claimed to effect wonderful cures for
such things.” He made the experiment and
found that it not only effected a painless but
also a quick cure. “It is an ill wind that
blows no one any good,” he said, “and now
I can recommend the use of this element for
burns and blisters.” He seemed quite delighted
to think that he had been hurt since
it gave him an opportunity of proving the
wonderful power of this new metal.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the storm was raging, our party
had heard the booming of cannon and had
seen sky-rockets ascend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they signals of distress from some
ship underneath us?” asked Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think so,” answered the captain, as
they now called the old man. “I’ll lower
our ship and see if we cannot assist them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently they saw an ocean-liner breasting
the winds and breakers, helpless in midocean,
without masts and with a big hole
in its side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is doomed!” cried the captain; “but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>we can save the passengers. Our ship will
float above her steady as a rock and I can
lower rope ladders so that her passengers
can reach our deck in safety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When the frightened passengers saw this
magnificent ship in mid-air above them they
thought it was a mirage or phantom-ship
sent to mock them in their despair, but when
they heard through the megaphone encouraging
words directing them to mount the
ladders to safety, they instantly complied
and soon every person on the disabled ship
from stevedore to captain was on the air-ship,
some with tears and sobs, others with
white haggard faces thanking the captain
for his timely coming. The last person had
barely placed his foot on the step of the
ladder when the ocean steamer gave a
mighty lurch and disappeared from sight as
if pulled under water by some merciless
mer-king.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the passengers recovered from their
fright they were profuse with their oh’s and
ah’s of admiration of the majestic ship they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>were now on, with its new electrical contrivances,
peculiar mode of lighting, and
the elegance and comfort of its furnishings.
Everything was examined from the bathtubs
to the stringed musical instruments that
vibrated harmonious, plaintive melodies as
the wind swept through them. They were
delighted with the frescoes and superb paintings
illustrative of scenes in space as well as
on land and water, which decorated the ceilings
and walls.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wrecked ship was bound for Liverpool
so the captain landed his passengers
there one fine morning before half the people
of that city were awake.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After bidding the shipwrecked people
good-bye, our party concluded to steer for
Siam, stopping at the city of Paris on their
way, for the Prince and Princess had never
visited this city of styles and wickedness.
They arrived there early one morning just
when the first rays of the Sun were lighting
the towers of Notre Dame and the captain
guided them directly to the Eiffel Tower
where they landed, planning to remain in
Paris for a few days, the captain, in the
meantime, would sail above the city and wait
for them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I will not stop to tell you all that they saw
or did during that memorable week, for
those who have been in Paris can imagine and
those who have not may hold it in anticipation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Suffice it to say that they all had, as
Ione put it, “the time of their lives,” visiting
theatres, Versailles, the Louvre, shopping,
driving in the parks, taking dinners at the
best hotels and suppers at the celebrated restaurants.
They were pretty well tired out
when they at last returned to the ship on the
appointed morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now we are off for Siam to see what
has taken place during your absence,” said
the captain. “I know you have called up the
picture of Siam on our magic mirror to see
how things were going but you could not talk
to your people as you will be able to do now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Magic Mirror is an apt name for the blue
vault which pictures the wonderful views we
have seen,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A penny for your thoughts, Prince,”
said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are not for sale but I will give them
to you if you will come here. I want to consult
you about something.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope it is not that you wish to leave
us when we reach Siam,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“No, indeed! Quite the contrary. I have
concluded that I do not wish to go to Siam
even for a visit and if you will come and sit
beside me I will tell you why. You see, if I
go to Siam my people will know that I am
alive and then my brother would have to give
up his throne which he so highly prizes, as
he would no longer be the rightful heir. Now
I care nothing for the throne so why not let
them still think me dead and allow my
brother to live in peace? When we first
thought of visiting Siam I did not realize
how my going would complicate matters, but
only thought of the pleasure it would give
the Princess and myself to surprise and see
them once more. Now, I feel that we must
forego the pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right, Prince. I, too, did not
think of the trouble your visit would cause.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We must speak to the captain and tell
him of our change of plans or we will be in
Siam and landing at the palace before we
know it at the rate of speed we are now traveling,”
said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>So they told the captain their afterthoughts
and he said their decision was a
wise one and added that it would have been
too bad to shorten the aerial trip of the Princess.
If he had stopped to visit his people
they naturally would not have been willing
that he continue his travels after getting
him back, as they thought, from the dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must not return to Earth to remain
until you have first visited Neptune, that
mystic planet far out in space on the very
borders of our solar system, to say nothing
of the beautiful and surprising places bordering
on the Milky Way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury now spoke, saying that he feared
he should not be able to accompany them
longer unless they returned to the heavens
immediately, for his time of leave would expire
before he could get to Neptune and return,
it was so very far away. “I want you
to see some of the independent islands also,
those not under the influence or sway of any
of the planets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goodness, gracious, me! If you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>thinking of leaving us, we will return to the
heavens this minute rather than lose you,
for no other guide would be acceptable to us
after having been led by you,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are very kind, but there are dozens
of other guides far superior to me,” said
Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course you would say that,” said the
Prince, “but we don’t know how good the
others are and we do know you, so we are
going back at once to those mysterious, fascinating
lands that float in heaven’s blue
ether.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Having all agreed to return with Mercury,
the captain pointed the bow of his trusty
ship in a direct oblique line for Uranus,
where he was to hand them over to Mercury
once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Although “The Queen” traveled with the
speed of electricity, it took several days for
our party to reach Uranus as, unlike their
magic robes, she could not quite do away
with time and space. On their way to
Uranus the captain told them if they should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>ever want for money all they had to do was
to go where there was a large deposit of radium
and sell enough to supply their needs,
for it was much more valuable than gold itself,
and he then proceeded to tell them
where they could always find this white
chemical in the form of crystals, which
much resembled salt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On Uranus we have no money or specie
of any kind,” he continued. “Our trading
is done by giving out thoughts and ideas.
Each man’s bank is his brain and he who has
the best brain is considered the wealthiest
man, while he is valued for what he actually
has done, and not for what he says he can do,
for the good of his race. No repetition of
others’ thoughts or bragging can be either
traded or taken in account here. A man
must do what he says he can do and he who
does the most for the public good is looked
upon and taken for the guide and ruler of
the island. All questions and decisions are
referred to him and all depend upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>judgment as to ways and means of settlement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How I wish things were arranged in that
way on our Earth,” said Harold. “Then the
right man would be in the right place every
time, and prosperity would be ensured.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see it! I see it!” exclaimed Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See what?” asked Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Uranus,” replied she.</p>

<p class='c009'>“True enough, she does,” said the captain.
“You have very sharp eyes, and now that the
way is clear I am going to use full speed.
Listen to the varied and peculiar tones the
air makes as it rushes by.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does it not sound weird?” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It makes me feel creepy and afraid,”
said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrors! What is the matter now!” exclaimed
Ione, for they had come to a sudden
stop.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” calmly replied the captain,
“only that we have reached our destination
and I lessened the speed to allow the ship to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>sink quietly down into the enclosure we
started from.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You mean to tell us we are really back!”
they exclaimed in chorus. “Only a few minutes
ago we were leagues away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So we were but, if you remember, I said
I intended using full speed,” replied the
captain, “and behold the result. Distance
was soon wiped out and time almost caught
up with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We can never thank you enough for this
pleasant trip. We have given up entirely
ever being able to pay our indebtedness to
you for all the charming treats you have
given us,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not thank me, for I have had equal
joy in seeing the successful result of my inventions
as well as witnessing your pleasure.
And now before we part I wish to give you
each a memento of the happy hours we have
spent together. My gift cannot be delivered
now, but some fine morning you will see
floating above each of your homes an air-ship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the exact counterpart of the one we are
now in.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were all too touched by his generosity
to be able to speak at first, but the Princess
quickly recovered herself and walked
shyly toward the old man. Throwing her
arms around his neck, she kissed him. Ione
did likewise while the Prince and Harold,
with moistened eyes, gripped his hands in
silent gratitude and appreciation, only saying
that it was too much for him to do. But
the old man only laughed and seemed exceedingly
happy in knowing that he had been
the means of giving them pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>You can well imagine how they lingered in
saying good-bye and would not be satisfied
until he had promised that he would visit
them when they were settled in the new
homes they were going to prepare when they
returned to Earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, Mercury, what can I give you?”
asked the old man. “I know that material
things are not desired by those who live in
space, and as a person cannot give a slice of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>his brains, the only valuable thing here, I
am at a loss to know what to give you to show
how much I appreciate your kindness in
bringing these young people to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pleasure of being with you all has
been sufficient recompense for me,” replied
Mercury, “and if you do not mind I should
like to return and learn from you some of
the wonderful secrets of nature you possess.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, my dear fellow, and come often.
I would be delighted to teach you anything I
know, for I am getting to be an old man and
some times feel that I have done my share of
work and would be glad to leave in younger
hands the tasks and studies that are still unfinished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long time after our party had
started for Neptune they felt quiet and subdued.
Ione did not talk and Harold forgot
to tease. They had traveled in silence for
some distance when Ione in a revery said,
“Neptune, god of the waters. I wonder if
we will find the planet’s Satellite Island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>nearly all water and its inhabitants floating
about in gondolas or queer-shaped barges
and boats, as the Venetians do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I expect we will,” said the Princess, “and
I have the funniest feeling, as if when I
reach there I shall have reached the end of
space and can look over the edge as I should
if the universe were a plate and Neptune a
big ball on its rim.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! you queer girl!” exclaimed Ione.
“You have the funniest ideas sometimes.
You make me laugh.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should think you would be afraid our
‘wishes’ would get out of order and we would
get stuck in space like a balky horse or, if
our magic robes failed to work, that we
would go whirling and speeding through
space like a comet,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harold, you are the worst tease I ever
knew,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, isn’t it true that all things wear out
with constant use? We have kept wishing,
wishing, and wishing that we might be first
in this place and then in that, or that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>could see this or the other thing until I
should think our robes would at least be
threadbare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sure it is lucky for us that our robes
are made of magical stuff or, as Harold says,
they would not only be threadbare but full
of holes as well,” said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look sharply and you will see just ahead,
first a flash of blue then a flash of green
light,” said Mercury. “Those are from
Neptune and as we draw nearer the lights
will shine with steady brilliancy.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Neptune was so far away that it required
repeated wishing to get there. Think of it!
It is 2,791,000,000 miles from the Sun, a distance
one cannot realize or grasp from cold
figures. It has to be compared to something
on Earth for one to form any definite idea of
its immensity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, one, two, three,” said Mercury.
“Let us make a last wish and it will surely
land us on Neptune’s Satellite Island.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They complied and in the twinkling of an
eye found themselves standing on a high
arched bridge facing, well! how can I describe
it? A magnificent white temple-like
edifice all domes, porticoes, and windows of
rainbow hues. It stood in the center of a
small island connected with the mainland by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>twelve bridges similar to the one on which
they were standing. Each bridge faced an
imposing column-porticoed entrance, with
broad sweeping steps leading to it, on either
side of which were symbolical figures that
represented the different signs of the Zodiac.
The entire temple was built in such a style
as to form an eight-pointed star, in the center
of which was a circle. The audience hall
was a stupendous circular room with twelve
doors leading from it. Overhead in the lofty
dome, which was of sapphire to represent
the blue of the sky, were sprinkled diamond
stars and differently colored jewels representing
each planet in its characteristic
color. Looking closely, one could see that
this dome was divided into twelve sections by
gold bands and in its center was one enormous
diamond representing the Sun, while
each division or section was marked by a
sign of the Zodiac, and the colored jewels
that represented the planets were placed in
the sign of the Zodiac in which they were
located at the time of the birth of Christ,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>while the whole circle was called “The Circle
of Life.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly underneath this dome was another
Zodiacal Circle set in the floor where
the planets moved by clock work and were always
to be found just where the real planets
in the heavens are each day in the year. This
temple was one dedicated to the twin sciences
Astronomy and Astrology. The people who
live on Neptune call Astronomy the backbone
and Astrology the soul of the science of
the stars.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is where one can have his horoscope
or life-wheel calculated, and can learn what
his talents, abilities, and future prospects
are,” said Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us go and have our future predicted,”
said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they stood on the bridge talking and
looking about them, beautiful gondolas had
been gliding along on the placid waters beneath.
Each gondola had elaborately carved
jewel-set figures, representing sea horses,
mermaids or Undines for its bow, and carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>a minstrel or musician, and its passengers
leaned on silken cushions apparently oblivious
to surroundings while listening to the
soft, plaintive tones that fell from harp, flute
or mandolin. The musical plash of the single
paddle which guided the pleasure-boats
furnished a harmonious accompaniment.
This was truly a silent city where carriage
wheels were never heard or the clatter of
horse’s hoofs, for there were no streets, only
canals and lagoons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose we cross this bridge and enter
the temple,” said Mercury. “I have a pass
that will admit us to all buildings on the
Satellite Islands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That will be agreeable to us,” answered
Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they wished themselves dressed in simple
white robes and then walked slowly over
the bridge and followed the path that led to
the Temple of Astrology. As they approached,
they saw a stately old man about
to descend the steps. He had a snowy beard
and flowing, white hair. A mantle of purple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>velvet was thrown across his shoulders and
on its hem were embroidered the signs of
the Zodiac in threads of gold. On his breast
flashed a diamond star, while on the third
finger of his left hand he wore a priceless
seal ring set with his birth-stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury recognized him at once as one of
the twelve wise men who presided over the
Wheel of Life set in the Temple floor, also
one of the “Brotherhood of Twelve,” a secret
order legally licensed to calculate horoscopes
and read the lives of people.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury introduced our party and told
the Brother that the ladies would like to
have their life-wheels read. He courteously
consented and offered also to show
them the marvelous telescope, with lens so
powerful that the star farthest away in space
could be brought into plain view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, if you will come with me I will tell
you a curious thing about this temple, for
though you may wonder why, you will soon
realize that you are drawn in a certain direction
as if by invisible hands. For instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>as you walk around the circular hall,
when you arrive at the door leading to that
sign of the Zodiac under which you were
born, you will feel an irresistible desire to
enter and stand on that sign in the Zodiacal
wheel set in the floor. Like, they say, attracts
like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I do not know which sign I was
born under,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does not matter in the least whether
you know or not,” replied the Brother.
“You will instinctively enter the door and
be most strongly attracted to the especial
sign which appeared at the eastern horizon
at the hour of your birth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What fun!” said Ione. “Let us walk
around and test it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How very interesting,” said the Princess.
“We can walk slowly and completely
around the circle taking a good look at each
entrance, then on the second round we can
enter the door that seems most attractive.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when you find that out,” continued
the Brother, “as you stand on the sign in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>wheel, I will tell you something of your disposition,
nature, and inclinations. Another
thing I will mention is that a special color is
also assigned to each sign, also a jewel which
is called one’s birth gem, and which it is
fortunate for one to wear. We planet people
wear ours on our third finger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why on the third finger?” queried Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because three is a sacred number and is
symbolical of many things. Another fact
about these signs is that each represents one
of the four elements, fire, earth, air, or water.
Look at the wheel in the dome and you will
see that each of its divisions is colored according
to the element it represents, red for
fire, brown for earth, blue for water, and
white for air. There are three red, three
brown, three white, and three blue sections.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the early astrologers were consulted
by two people with regard to marriage,
and found that one was born under a
sign representing fire, while the other was
born under one representing water, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>would advise them not to marry, for one
would be warm-hearted, impulsive, and impetuous
while the other would be slow and
easy-going, so that, not being congenial, they
would not be happy together. Fire is
quenched by water, while water is disturbed
and made to steam or boil by fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How very interesting this study of the
stars must be,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I mean to pursue it,” said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you think simply the signs are interesting
to hear about, you would find the position
of the planets in the different signs
perfectly fascinating, but the stars are a
life-long study and the longer one studies
them the more absorbed one becomes. Shall
we begin our circuit around the hall now? I
am always interested to know through
what door one is inclined to enter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they leisurely sauntered along they
plied the Brother with numberless questions
and when any of their number would stop
unusually long before any door, the others
would immediately ask, “Do you think that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>leads to your sign?” or “Do you truly feel
inclined to enter that door?” and so between
questions and much laughter they finished
their first round.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Over the first doorway they saw a ram’s
head and the first sign of the Zodiac called
Aries, while on either side of the broad steps
leading to the portico were lambs lying at
rest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry to be the first to leave you,”
said Harold, “but I am strongly attracted
this way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Really, are you?” exclaimed Ione. “I
don’t feel attracted toward it in the least,
and I should think I would, loving you as I
do.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all! Not at all!” responded the
Brother. “That has nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, good-bye, we will soon join you in
the temple,” they cried as they walked toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the second entrance. Over this door
they saw the head of a bull and the second
sign of the Zodiac called Taurus, while two
ferocious-looking bulls stood on either side
of the entrance. No one seemed inclined to
pass through here.</p>

<p class='c009'>Over the third entrance they saw the
carved figures of The Twins symbolizing
the third sign, Gemini, but all passed by.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they approached the next door, however,
Ione said, “I feel decidedly attracted
this way,” and entered the door over
which was to be seen the Crab, symbolical of
the fourth sign, Cancer.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Ione passed through the doorway, the
Princess said, “I wonder what sign will attract
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think you will like Virgo best,” replied
the Brother, and so it proved, for they
all passed the fifth door over which they saw
the Lion and when they neared the sixth entrance,
that of Virgo, represented by a beautiful
carved figure of a virgin, the Princess
said, “You are right, Brother, if this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Virgo, for I want to enter here, so good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After leaving Virgo, they passed the door
over which was seen the scales or balance
representing the seventh sign, Libra; the
one over which a huge serpent was curled,
representing the eighth sign, Scorpio, one
over which was to be seen the Archer, with
his bow and arrow, the ninth sign, Sagittarius,
then past Capricornus, symbolized by
the Goat, on to the eleventh sign, Aquarius,
the Water-Bearer. Here the Prince paused.
“This is my sign,” he said, “for it is the
first I have felt drawn toward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right,” replied the Brother.
“It is yours and I will enter with you and
see what the others think of their respective
signs. You have made the complete round
of the signs with the exception of the
twelfth, Pisces, which is symbolized by the
Fishes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are glad to see you at last, Prince,”
Harold cried. “We thought perhaps you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>were hard to please and could not find a sign
to suit you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, no,” he replied, “but I had to almost
complete the circle before I found where I
belonged.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now,” said the Brother, “I will tell you
in a few words some of your inclinations, according
to your signs, but you must remember
that these will be greatly modified or
accentuated as the case may be, according
to the position which different planets held
at the hour of your births. It would take
too long to calculate planetary positions and
give you an exact reading of your future,
so I will confine myself to what the birth
sign shows for each. I will commence with
Mrs. Fredericks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Oh!” laughed Ione, “For mercy’s
sake don’t call me Mrs. It sounds so grown
up and queer. Please call me Ione.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well then, Ione. Being born under
the sign Cancer which belongs to the water
division you will largely partake of the nature
of that element and will be changeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and restless, having many ups and downs in
fortune and position, also dangers especially
of captivity. Journeys or voyages are
certain to be frequent and long. You are
frequently in danger from falls or hurts
from horses, even wounds by human hands
are to be feared. As to your inclinations
you are gifted with a fertile imagination
and you delight in strange scenes and in adventure.
You can easily adapt yourself to
both places and people, the friendship and
attachment of others is an imperative need
of your nature. You are discreet and independent
and very capable in a variety of
ways. As the Moon has great influence over
the tides, so too it will strongly influence
you, causing you to feel elated and happy
then correspondingly gloomy and depressed.
But the strongest characteristic of this sign
is the sympathy it inspires and the love for
home and children. You are very intuitive
and can be governed by love rather than
ruled by fear. You are impatient of control
and have little sympathy or liking for
narrow, conventional people, while very
fond of the beautiful whether in nature or
in art, having decidedly artistic tastes. Your
astral colors are green and russet brown.
Your jewels, the emerald and black onyx.”</p>

<p>THEY WERE SOON GLIDING THROUGH CANAL AFTER CANAL<br><br>(p. <a href='#Page_128'>128</a>)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“But you have not told me any of my
faults,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These I never tell with this kind of a
reading. I only tell them when I give the
influence of the planets.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercury read Harold’s horoscope, so he
can’t have his told again but we should like
to hear what you can tell the Princess,” said
Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well! She is modest, reticent and
must be well known to be well understood as
she keeps her talents in the background and
never obtrudes them upon people. She is an
exceptionally good nurse as her hands possess
and impart a soothing, magnetic influence.
She is kind and agreeable in company
and very confiding where affection is given.
She naturally inspires the confidence of her
friends and will be the recipient of many secrets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which she will loyally keep. She is
well endowed mentally, is ingenious and
even-tempered, not easily angered but reasonable
and just in her disposition. Long
voyages in search of wealth or in connection
with property in foreign countries, are indicated.
Frequent changes of residence are
shown, and residences or property in two
places. A goodly share of this world’s goods
will fall to her share, for her symbol the
Virgin or the Gleaner promises much. With
thrift and an economical nature she combines
an almost clairvoyant power of discrimination
and foresight. She must be
known to be appreciated.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After giving these short readings, the
Brother asked if they would partake of
some light refreshments, assuring them that
if they did not like what was served they
could not but be pleased with the beautiful
scene which would be laid before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They gladly assented and he quickly led
them from the Temple to the water’s edge
where lay a magnificent gondola which they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>entered and in which they were soon gliding
through canal after canal until at last
they shot out from under a low hanging balcony
into a Court of Honor, lighted by myriads
upon myriads of colored lamps and
found themselves surrounded by dozens and
dozens of other gondolas floating or at rest
while their occupants, leaning back in graceful
poses, listened to the most sublime
music mortal ears had ever heard. The musicians
sat in beautiful boat-shaped baskets
made of flowers and suspended in air by
most beautiful, silken balloons that floated
overhead carrying various colored lamps
and giving the scene the appearance of hundreds
of fireflies flitting here and there.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the center of this Court of Honor was
an island on which was a pavilion of peculiar
but beautiful design where refreshments
were served. This Court was so large that
the magnificent buildings that surrounded it
were seen but faintly, which added greatly
to the scene as they seemed wrapped in a
bluish purple mist, with only a white column
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>showing here and there lit by the reflection
of some colored light. Here one saw a pink
fluted column half wreathed in mist; there
another glistening with a pale, green color,
while in the cool depths of the water on
which they were floating could be seen reflections
of the entire scene as in a mirror.</p>

<p class='c009'>Golden statues of females holding torches
in their upraised arms lit this gloriously
beautiful court at regular intervals; broad
steps led to the water’s edge at the gondola
landings, while magnificent colossal statues
of animals on broad pedestals stood as if
guarding the waterways.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! how beautiful!” they all exclaimed
in tones of subdued ecstacy.</p>

<p class='c009'>After they had feasted their eyes upon this
view and had listened to the divine strains
of music that were wafted to them on gentlest
breezes, the Brother gave a signal to
the gondolier to take them to the island.
While seated here he asked many questions
about Earth and seemed greatly interested
in what they related. Then he told them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>what great changes had taken place since he
had lived there, but what astonished them
most was that he had been an astrologer on
the lost island of Atlantis, and that he had
been on top of a high tower when the island
was submerged. “There has never been or
ever will be such magnificent men and
women as lived then,” concluded the
Brother, “for so much sin and disease has
crept into the world that it has destroyed
the race physically and morally to a great
extent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the old man spoke again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you heard of ambrosia that the
gods lived upon? Well, I am going to offer
you some of it with some of our wafers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After tasting the ambrosia Ione said, “It
tastes like the honey from a flower wet with
dew and has the bouquet of rose and violets,
while it makes one feel as if every drop of
blood in him was a living cell of life and
joy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t wonder the gods were so powerful,”
said Harold, “if they lived on this nectar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>for it certainly is the most delicious
thing I ever tasted.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This praise greatly pleased the Brother.
“Look in the west,” he said, pointing his
finger to indicate where the west was, up
among the clouds.</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked and then caught their breath.
Forming a background to this beautiful
Court of Honor was what appeared to be
the lights of an Aurora Borealis while
spanning it all was a rainbow of dazzling
brightness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When these lights appear,” said Mercury,
“it is a signal that I must return to
my island home shortly and as I want you to
see the Milky Way and several independent
islands we have in space I think we had
best bid adieu to the Brother and hasten
on.” With many hand grasps and farewells
they bade the Brother good-bye and
once more floated off into the blue ether,
wrapped in their magic robes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The Sun’s Satellite Island was most
glorious to behold, being bathed in dancing
sunbeams which twirled in and around everything
and threw a veil of splendor over
all. This was called the Isle of Gold, as it
looked like one gigantic ball of that precious
metal when seen from afar. Gold mines
abounded, formed as it seemed of petrified
sunbeams. The flowers and leaves of plants
and trees opened and shut at the rising and
setting of the Sun as do the lotus and marigold.
The birds too, sang at sunrise to herald
the coming of the messenger of day. A
great many large animals were seen here,
such as the lion, wolf, bear, bull, and ox.
The people were broad-minded, whole-souled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>and cheerful, their one aim in life
being to make others happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the Sun Island they went to the island
under the Moon, an island locked in the
grip of perpetual slumber. What a contrast
they found! It was like going from
life to death. It had been struck by a blighting
blast and everything had been turned
to stone; even the trees, birds, and beasts
were petrified, although they had retained
their natural colors. No one lived here and
the only persons seen were visitors from
other islands, and these were generally of a
melancholy, despondent turn of mind, and
they moved about like ghosts, in shroud-like
white robes.</p>

<p class='c009'>After our travelers had visited all of the
planets’ Satellite Islands, Ione said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why! I never thought of it before, but
if all of the planets have satellite or tributary
islands the Earth must, also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are right,” said Mercury. “Earth
has its Satellite Islands but instead of one
it has many, and they revolve around the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Earth from east to west. Opposite each zone
out in space revolves an island corresponding
in temperature and in vegetation to the
zone it represents and all of these are connected
with the earth by rainbow bridges
which appear and disappear as there are
souls that wish to pass over to any of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The passport to these islands is a pure
heart full of love and sympathy for everything
that lives and breathes. None other
can pass over the frail rainbow bridges to
these islands which are called the ‘Isles of
the Blest.’ Many people have seen these
rainbow bridges when they have been
spanned for the passage of a soul to one of
the islands but they have not known that instead
of the pot of gold, which children have
been told was to be found at the other end,
there was one of the most beautiful, peaceful,
quiet islands that ever floated in space.
On the one opposite the Temperate Zone
spirits live that prefer that temperature,
while those who prefer cold weather go to
the island opposite the Frigid Zone, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>on, for there is a climate suited to every
taste, and because of this every one is happy
and contented, being in a congenial atmosphere
which is conducive to joy and contentment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No growling over the weather such as
is heard on Earth, is ever indulged in here.
Spirits always live with those who are congenial
and have tastes similar to their own,
so no quarreling is ever heard, neither are
divorces ever necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The most desirable place of all is that
island opposite and tributary to the Temperate
Zone, for here everything is temperate
like the climate, neither too hot nor yet
too cold. The inhabitants are high spirited,
joyous, and happy, being employed from
morning till night in making others happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deceit, lying, stealing, and anger are all
unknown here, so you see, it is very appropriately
named The Isle of the Blessed,”
concluded Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>By this time they had reached Do-As-You-Please
Land.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“What queer-looking people and houses
they have here!” said Ione. “No two persons
are dressed alike nor are there two
houses the same size or color. There is a
queer-looking house over there and no two
sides are painted the same color.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! goodness! look at that funny hat that
woman is wearing. It is like a small parasol
with the stick cut off and when she enters
a building she pulls a string and it shuts
up,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” answered Ione, “but look at that
woman with the laced-in waist, high-heeled
slippers and huge bustle and panniers. She
is talking to that tall, slim woman with flat
chest and clothes made almost skin tight.
Why do the inhabitants of this land dress
so differently?” asked Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because this is the Land of Do-As-You-Please
and every one dresses according to
his or her particular idea of comfort or
beauty. Come and I will show you some of
the queerest homes you ever looked at.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were loth to leave the queer-looking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>peculiar people even to see their more peculiar
houses, but finally started to walk down
the principal residence street. They saw
children dressed in the funniest clothes that
mortal mind ever thought of or designed.
Some had rubber suits so that if it rained or
they fell in the water they would not get wet.
Others were dressed in silk, satin and laces
or Little Lord Fauntleroy styles. Still others
were bare-footed with only a calico slip for
a dress. Some of the mothers had their hair
done up high on the head or in a mass of
curls and puffs, others wore it parted in the
middle and brushed so smoothly that a fly
alighting upon it would slip and break
its neck. But the houses! How queer and
quaint they were built after original designs
of the owners. One, for instance, a
yellow frame with white trimmings had one
large long room on the ground floor with a
high square tower on one corner, four
stories high, with steps from the outside.
This we called the Light-House.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, of all homely houses this is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>homeliest!” said Harold. “I wonder what
they do in rainy weather with the steps on
the outside!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The man who lived next door evidently
believed the only way to build a house was
to have all the rooms on the ground floor so
as to do away with climbing stairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next man had few windows and small
ones at that, seeming to like a cool, dark
house; while his next door neighbor delighted
in light and windows and had so
many that his house was called the glass
house; and so on, and so on. One liked one
thing, another liked its opposite and each
built as he pleased.</p>

<p class='c009'>The grounds surrounding these houses
were quite as characteristic of different
tastes as the houses. Some yards were laid
out in set flower-beds, others with the flowers
running wild and untrained while still
others had not a flower or shrub to break
the even roll of the grass-sown lawn.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of the people had their meals served
three times a day, some four times, and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>only twice. Some went to bed with the
chickens and got up with the Sun while others
went to bed at Sunrise, after a night of
merry-making or dancing. Some believed
in study, others in passing the time as best
one can only looking out for the fun of the
moment; while still others thought only of
the future; and, as there are no Mrs. Grundys,
each one did as he pleased and no unpleasant
or unkind remarks were made.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the inhabitants attend strictly to their
own business and let others do the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After all, then, these queer people living
in their quaint houses have one custom which
it would be well for our Earth people to
emulate,” said the Prince, in which all the
rest of the party laughingly acquiesced.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To the east of the North Star our travelers
saw a beautiful rose-tinted island and,
on consulting Mercury, found it to be the
Isle of Candy. On it everything was composed
of sweets of some kind. Chocolate
took the place of soil, while the benches in
the parks were made of twisted molasses
candy. Soda waters of different shades and
color filled the fountains and looked beautiful
as well as inviting as they sparkled in
the sunlight. The summer-houses were
made of peanut candy representing spotted
stone, and the lovely little pagodas throughout
the park were of white paste all fluted
and carved. The very gravel and walks
were made of mixed candies resembling different
colored pebbles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>In the very centre of the island was a
marvelous castle of sparkling rock candy
while its water-pipes ran lemonade, wine
and sparkling champagne. A lovely rose-bush
clambered over its white porch and
on this bush were beautiful pink roses all
of candy. This castle was situated on a
knoll that sloped to a miniature lake of clear
mineral water while on its surface floated
tiny canoes of sassafras and cinnamon bark.
On the same lake were trim little steamers
made of cream candy with striped peppermint
sticks for smoke-stacks. On the banks
of this lake were candied violets and crystalized
sour-grass. Everything to be seen both
far and near was a perfect imitation of some
natural object. There were candy animals
and birds in the park and, had you breakfasted
in the castle, you would have been
served with candy mutton-chops and candy
eggs on candy toast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did you ever see anything so perfectly
sweet in all your life?” cried the girls in
chorus.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“No, we never did since it is all candy
and consequently would be sweet,” said
Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This must be where most of the Christmas
candies come from,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I could carry away that cherry
tree,” said Ione. “See how perfect it is, its
bark of brown maple sugar, its leaves of
pistache candy and its fruit the real cherries
candied. My! but they are good, just taste
one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After eating all they cared for and drinking
at the different fountains, they went to
the edge of the island and then flew away toward
what looked like a large amethyst.
Mercury explained that it was “The Isle of
Toys.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they approached this island they saw,
bordering its coast line, a diminutive city set
on seven hills like ancient Rome. At its
wharfs lay beautiful little steamers, while
tiny sailboats went speeding by, sailing
through the blue ether as smoothly as if on
the water. They saw also, hurrying crowds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of the prettiest doll-faced people imaginable.
And why should they not be pretty and look
like dolls when they <i>were</i> dolls, only living
ones that could both walk and talk. Dolls of
all kinds and conditions, Mercury explained,
were the only inhabitants of this Island of
Toys.</p>

<p class='c009'>Back from the coast, in the interior of the
isle, lived the large dolls; in the mountains,
the Indian dolls; in the hot part, the African
dolls; in the cold part, the Esquimaux;
in the tea-growing district, the Chinese, and
so on, for every race of man was represented
by these tiny creatures who lived, worked,
and talked exactly as these races of people
do on Earth. In fact, here was a good place
to study the different peoples of the globe
for, as Ione said, “Here you have the whole
world in a nut-shell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The dolls that landed from the little
steamers at the wharfs represented as many
different nationalities as one sees crossing
the renowned bridge at Constantinople;
the one where rumor says one can see every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>nationality on the globe pass every hour in
the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ione, do look at that Turkish doll with
his baggy, yellow satin trousers, red fez, and
long pipe!” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but he is not half as cute as that
Chinaman with the long pig-tail and paper
umbrella, who is fanning himself as he
walks,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I feel like a giant when I look down
upon these tiny people,” said Harold. “I
am afraid we may step on some of them.
The largest one I have yet seen does not exceed
six inches in height.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There live on the farther shore of this
island dolls that are as large as a two-year-old
child,” explained Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See the dolls getting into street cars
and carriages just as we do, when they get
to the end of the wharf,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And observe those express wagons
loaded with trunks and the drays with merchandise,
while the Clydesdale horses are
no bigger than kittens,” said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“Listen,” said Harold, “I thought I
heard a locomotive whistle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you did,” replied Mercury. “Look
to your left and you will see the most complete
little depot, with waiting-rooms, lunch
counters, ticket offices, etc., facsimiles of
those on Earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure,” exclaimed Harold, “and
there is a turn-table turning an engine at
this moment, with little men working the
switches.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had I seen this place when I was a little
youngster,” said the Prince, “I should have
had to stop to play with these fascinating little
trains, especially those bound for the
stock-yards, loaded with cows and horses no
larger than the animals that furnish a good-sized
Noah’s Ark.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us float over the residence part and
see what the houses look like inside and how
these people live,” suggested Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suppose we follow this little lady who
has just come out of that dry-goods store
and entered her brougham with a coachman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and footman on the box. The brougham
drawn by the bang-tailed bay horses,” suggested
the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just the thing,” cried Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Harold, “you girls go on while
the Prince, Mercury and I go to the theatre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well. We must be off before we
lose sight of our little lady’s brougham.
See you later, au revoir!” cried Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>Away went the girls, while the boys entered
the miniature theatre which they were
only able to do because of the power of their
magic robes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently the little brougham turned into
a beautiful park where there were winding
drives, fountains, and flowers everywhere,
and stopped in front of a lovely palace of
white marble. The footman opened the
door of the brougham, the little lady
alighted, passed up the broad steps to the
front entrance and disappeared within the
exquisitely carved doors which were opened
by a tiny butler in quaint livery.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>With a feeling of disappointment, the
girls saw her disappear from view. “Oh,
isn’t she too tiny, sweet, and lovely for
words!” exclaimed the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How I wish we were not so large and
could go inside to see how her palace is furnished,”
said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have forgotten that our magic robes
can make us large or small, as well as invisible,”
replied the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure I had. Let us wish ourselves
the size of the little lady and that we may
float through one of her windows and be able
to explore the palace unobserved and undisturbed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Once inside, the girls found themselves
in a marble tessellated hall with walls lined
with ancestral portraits and coats of mail.
On either side of the hall were rooms
through the portiers of which they caught
glimpses of rugs of Oriental splendor, brocaded-satin
furniture in solid gold frames,
statuettes of Parian marble, while roses and
white hyacinths were everywhere. At the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>farther end of the hall was the dining-room
with its tapestried walls, old oaken furniture,
crystal chandeliers, dainty silver, and
sparkling cut glass.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Isn’t this magnificent,” exclaimed both
girls in a voice of wonder, “and just as if
we were looking through the wrong end of
our opera glasses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They next ascended a lovely stairway and
entered a boudoir with rose pink furnishings.
Before one of the many miniature
mirrors with which its walls were lined, sat
our little lady while a maid was busy in
brushing her fluffy golden hair. The adjoining
room was a nursery. Here in a
pretty bassinet, all lace and frills, slept a
tiny, rosy-cheeked baby no larger than one’s
little finger; while on the floor near by sat
a small boy doll building a block house, and
as he played his nurse read to him from a
diminutive Mother Goose Book.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I declare! They have Mother
Goose even in Toy Land!” exclaimed Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>They next descended to the kitchen where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>they saw the little cook making pies no
larger than one’s thumb nail and these she
baked in a cute little range as perfect in its
mechanism as our larger ones.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose we must be going or the boys
will be waiting for us,” said the Princess,
“but I should enjoy remaining much
longer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As they floated away they heard the tones
of a piano, for the little daughter of the
house was taking her music lesson, while a
Canary bird in its golden-wired cage was
trying to outvie her by filling the air with
sweet, flute-like tremulous tones.</p>

<p class='c009'>They found the boys awaiting them and
were soon floating along together. They saw
little farmers plowing the fields; little millers
tending the mill and putting the snowy
flour into sacks; tiny cattle grazing in the
pastures, lying in the shade to rest, or standing
knee-deep in the sparkling streams to
cool their feet, while on the hill-tops the tiny
windmills spun in this and in that direction
with the shifting of the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Isn’t this the cutest isle you ever saw?
There is a toy representative of everything
we have on Earth even to threshing machines
and automobiles,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It certainly is a most enchanting place.
These wee people go about their business as
if they were large men and women,” said
the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and they seem as independent as
Punch or a pig on ice in the way they go
about it,” answered Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are you going to show us next,
Mercury, dear, in this storehouse of space?”
questioned the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I shall take you to the island
where all the animals come when they die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, do!” said Ione. “Perhaps I can
then see the pets I used to love.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well, when I say three, all wish
yourselves on the island called Isle of Pet
Animals and we will be there.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Grazing on the sunny hillsides, lying
asleep under the shade trees, or frolicking
about the meadows they saw, literally, the
lion and the lamb lying down together, for
on this peaceful island, where no cruel man’s
gun had ever been fired or angry master’s
whip been used, animals of all kinds lived as
peacefully as if belonging to the same happy
family.</p>

<p class='c009'>The island was very large and all changes
of climate were common to it as well as
every kind of animal known to man, from
the polar bear of the frigid zone to the hippopotamus
of torrid climes, but the most
wonderful thing about all these animals was
that they could talk, though each had a language
characteristic of its particular breed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>as well as a language common to all, so that
each could make his wants or needs known
to any and all about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>When our young people heard this they
were delighted beyond expression. “I was
never so glad of any one thing in all my life
as to know that a time has come when animals
can talk and make themselves understood,”
said Ione. “I have always felt that
they could and would some day because the
expression of their eyes is so intelligent, and
from the pathetic looks they have often
given us, I have been sure they knew our
minds and comprehended our troubles even
though they could not tell us so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us show ourselves to them without
our magic robes, and see if any of our old-time
pets are here and will recognize us,”
said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bow-wow-wow!” barked a dog behind
Ione and turning she saw a noble Saint Bernard
with eyes beaming with love and tail
wagging with joy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Oh, Hero! you old darling, how are
you?” cried Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am very well, I thank you,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hearing her old playfellow answer in a
deep bass voice came almost as a shock to
Ione even though she had just been told that
all animals on this island talked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why are you so astonished to hear me
speak?” he cried. “You used constantly to
say to me ‘Speak, Hero, speak, I know you
can talk if you try!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; I know, Hero, but now that you do
talk, it seems strange and you must give me
time to get used to it. Did you always understand
everything I said to you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I did, and it nearly broke my
heart when you asked me to speak and I
could not. If you will come with me I will
show you around and you can see other pets
you used to have on Earth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When they turned to go they saw her Indian
pony that had been her almost constant
companion while with the Indians.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And here is Whistle!” she exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>patting her pony, so named because he made
the wind whistle by as he ran, he was so fleet-footed.
“You dear, dear pony. I am too rejoiced
for words to see you again, for I
never expected to lay eyes on you again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All I can say, Sweet-Face, is that I am
delighted to know that you escaped from the
Indians, for I heard that they were going
to force you to marry Mud Face when he returned
from his hunting trip, the trip on
which Mr. Harold killed him. I had made up
my mind to run away with you and try to
reach the nearest settlement before I would
see you married to that cruel fiend, even if
you thought I was going crazy for not obeying
the pull on my reins. We ponies as well
as other animals are often misunderstood
when we try in our own dumb way to help
our masters and mistresses, for they cannot
always interpret our actions and signals, so
often think us disobedient when we are
really trying to serve them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You dearest darling!” exclaimed Ione,
“to think that you were trying to plan a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>to save me and I did not even know that they
intended marrying me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew you did not, but I overheard it
by chance, as I grazed peacefully about
while listening to Mud Face and Old Heron
Feather talk, wrapped in their blankets
near the camp-fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! here come my pet doves,” she cried,
as a flock of white pigeons alighted on her
head, shoulders and outstretched hands.
“You beauties! Where did you come from
and how do you like it up here where you
never need to have a fear of being stoned or
shot?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking up, she saw Harold riding off on
a pet horse he used to own, while the Prince
was petting an elephant he used to ride in
processions in Siam. The Princess had her
arms around the neck of a gazelle and all
this time Mercury stood near smiling to see
them all so happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh mercy! here comes a bear out of the
woods,” cried the Princess as she ran toward
the Prince for protection. But Mercury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>quieted her fears by telling her that it
was perfectly harmless as were all the rest
of the animals here, even to the usually ferocious
Bengal tigers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am sorry, but am afraid I must hurry
you,” said Mercury, “if you wish to visit all
the places yet to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! do we have to go?” said Ione. “I
am so sorry to leave my old pets so soon. I
would dearly like to take them back to
Earth with me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So do I feel sorry to part with them so
soon,” said the Prince; “but it is a great
comfort to know that they all live again and
that we shall see them again some day.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then away they all flew. Their next stopping
place, Mercury told them, was to be the
Frost King’s Isle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly over the North Pole is the island
of the Frost King, glistening in the sun like
countless diamonds, one mass of pure white
snow, frost and ice. Every tree is draped
with lace-like festoons of frost and ice;
every river is clear as crystal and frozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>hard; while the Ice King’s palace is built of
blocks of glistening ice. Before the entrance
are couchant lions of solid ice. The carving
round doors and windows, like chiseled
marble apples, pears, and grapes, was all
done by Jack Frost. The people of the Isle
were dressed in white furs. The only animals
were white polar bears, white spitz
dogs, and white birds. The combined effect
of all this dazzling white was beautiful as a
dream, and all was greatly enhanced when
colored lights were seen twinkling under the
snow-capped windows.</p>

<p class='c009'>As our travelers sped past, Ione said,
“This is the coldest region we ever saw, now
please show us the hottest one you have.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” Mercury replied. “Wish
yourselves over the equator on the Isle of
Fire and you will find yourselves in a
warmer place than you have even dreamed
of.” Almost before this wish had been
formed they found themselves gasping for
breath on the Fire Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>All around them were bonfires, while in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the distance a volcano belched forth fire and
hot lava. The streams were liquid fire, with
blue flames rising from them, and the shores
of the rivers were red hot sand. They did not
tarry long on this Isle for their human lungs
could not endure the heat for long and they
begged to be taken away before they suffocated.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next place they visited was the Isle
of Vinegar, so named because everything
there was sour. The faces of all the people
looked wrinkled, sour and yellow from eating
so many sour things and drinking nothing
but lemonade and lime juice. After taking
a drink of lemonade without any sugar
in it (for sugar is unknown in this land) our
young friends started on their way for the
Milky Way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad that people on Earth like
more than one thing. It is much nicer having
a variety of things, sweet, sour, bitter
and medium than all one kind. After all,
medium things and people are generally
best. Those who are not too gentle, too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>cross, too learned, too stupid, too lively, too
quiet but are a combination of each and all,
these are the most congenial people to live
with,” sagely remarked Ione.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“We will now go to the Milky Way, that
broad stream of sparkling stars that sweeps
through the heavens like a mighty river and
on either side of which are reared the palaces
of the gods, goddesses, and heroes of
Greece and Rome,” said Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! You don’t mean to tell us that
the gods and goddesses of old live here?”
exclaimed Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly I do; and they live in regal
splendor as of yore. What is more, you are
going to be in time to see them start on their
yearly journey to Mount Olympus. The
procession they form is considered one of
the grandest sights of the heavens and one
which none of the planet people would voluntarily
miss seeing. The gods and goddesses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>heroes and heroines sweep down the
Milky Way in magnificent floats or barges
of gold and silver incrusted with precious
stones, while those looking on line the shores
or sit in boats at anchor, for no one is allowed
the freedom of the Milky Way while
the procession is passing,” said the guide.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, what a spectacle it will be!” said the
Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It certainly is one of the most gorgeously
magnificent pageants I have ever
witnessed,” said Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure we shall be there in time?”
asked Ione. “I would not miss it for
worlds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we can easily reach there if we do
not tarry on our way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, we will pass things by even if we
have to return to see them later,” said Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All ready then. One, two, three, and we
are off for a cloud bank that juts out into the
Milky Way making a fine point for us to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>view the entire procession as it turns the
bend,” said the guide.</p>

<p class='c009'>In less time than it took them to count one,
two, three, they were at their destination
and were barely seated when the Princess
exclaimed, “Sh! I hear strains of music,”
and looking in the direction from which the
sounds came, they saw a beautiful float gliding
smoothly along. On it were standing
twelve youths and twelve maidens playing
upon golden harps and horns. They were
crowned with roses, while violets and myrtle
were profusely festooned about them. The
youths had only a spotted leopard skin
thrown across their shoulders while the
maidens were attired in filmy white slips
with belts of blue ribbon.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following them came Jupiter in all his
royal splendor like some conquering king or
hero. His jeweled chariot was drawn by
four milk-white horses; his robes were royal
purple lined with spun gold and bordered
with precious gems. On his head he wore a
helmet of gold on which with outstretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>wings rested an eagle—a bird dedicated to
him by the ancients.</p>

<p class='c009'>Juno, wife of Jupiter and Queen of the
Heavens, came next, attended by her faithful
messenger, Iris, with wings of gold and
robe of rainbow hues. She hovered at the
side of her mistress who rode in a chariot
drawn by peacocks, her favorite fowls.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mars followed in a chariot of burnished
brass drawn by fiery horses. He was dressed
as a warrior armed for battle with red
breast-plate, and shield upraised. On his
war-bonnet perched a woodpecker while at
his feet crouched a wolf. Both the woodpecker
and wolf are sacred to Mars.</p>

<p class='c009'>Twelve white pigeons heralded the approach
of Venus in her pink-tinted shell-chariot
emblazoned with emeralds, pearls,
and corals, and drawn by snow-white swans,
which were dedicated to her by the ancients.
Her robe was of palest green, sprinkled with
pearls and embroidered to represent seafoam.
A magic girdle encircled her waist.
In her hands she carried violets and maidenhair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>ferns. At her side stood a basket of
pomegranates, sweet pears and figs. As the
chariot passed, one could scent the perfume
of thyme, myrtle, and musk, perfumes especially
pleasing to her, as was the flavor of
the fruits at her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came Mercury, son of Jupiter and
messenger of the gods, with winged sandals
and tortoise-shell lyre. Slung across his
shoulder was his serpent-entwined wand,
one touch of which would awaken those who
slept, or put to sleep those who were awake.</p>

<p class='c009'>Minerva, daughter of Jupiter, goddess of
wisdom and war, and protectress of the elegant
and useful arts, came next. Her barge
was appropriately decorated with the olive
branch and fruit. In its bow, half hidden,
were owls (birds of wisdom), and cocks,
which were sacred to her memory. On the
corners of her barge were golden plows and
rakes, emblems of agriculture; while here
and there were also spinning wheels and distaffs,
emblems of the useful arts. Her warlike
tastes were displayed by her dress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>which was a complete suit of armor, the
breast-plate of which was the head of Medusa.
She carried a golden staff and looked
magnificently beautiful and strong with
commanding figure, noble brow, and flashing
eyes as she stood tall and erect without turning
her head to right or to left as she floated
down this silvery stream.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Diana’s barge was a miniature cave to
represent the one in the glade where the
goddess of the chase and the moon used to
repair to bathe and refresh herself after the
hunt. Reposing before the cave were her
faithful nymphs and all were listening to
the sweet music Apollo, her twin brother,
was drawing from his lute.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vesta, the goddess of the hearth or home,
was seated in front of an altar before which
burned the sacred fire. The barge was festooned
in myrtle and guided by twelve vestal
virgins.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vulcan stood before a fiery furnace in the
midst of Lotus trees arranged to represent
a forest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Ceres, goddess of fruit and cereals, led two
oxen yoked to a plow. In her train were
woven heads of golden wheat; under her
arm she carried a cornucopia out of which
poured luscious fruits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Neptune’s barge was drawn by sea-horses
with flowing manes. Their harness was of
silver, crusted with pearls. Neptune himself,
god of the sea, wore a rich mantle embroidered
with sea anemones and shells.
On his head he wore a crown of pearls and
emeralds while in his right hand he held his
trident, studded with precious gems gathered
from the depths of ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following Neptune came Penelope, spinning
the web which at night she would unravel,
thus representing those who always
work but never accomplish anything.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Penelope rode Bellerophon on his
celebrated charger, Pegasus, the winged
horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then came Atlas bearing the globe upon
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>And next, Pandora, with her fatal box.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Aurora, goddess of dawn, followed, sitting
in her chariot of gold drawn by pure white
horses. She was clothed in garments only
equaled in color and splendor by the tints
of the Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p class='c009'>Following Aurora came Perseus, with
Minerva’s shield, Pluto’s helmet, and Mercury’s
winged shoes and wand.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Eolus with the contrary winds tied
up in the hide of an ox; followed by Somnus,
god of sleep, smelling a poppy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bacchus, the god of wine, passed with
overflowing cup in hand and wreath of
grapes and leaves upon his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now, Medusa with hair of hissing
serpents; Rhea, the goddess of Earth, leading
a tame tiger to show how she could tame
the beasts of the forest; then Flora, the goddess
of flowers, scattering a profusion of
flowers and blossoms as she passed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hercules, incarnation of strength, now
appeared dressed in a lion’s skin, with its
head for a helmet. In one hand he carried
his knotted club, while with the other he led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the Arcadian stag with golden antlers and
brazen feet, which he had caught. Behind
him came his wife, Hebe, goddess of youth,
carrying her cup of nectar, ready to wait
upon the gods, for that was her office.</p>

<p class='c009'>Last but not least came Pluto, god of the
lower world and of the dead. None of the
goddesses would marry him because it was
such a gloomy place down in Hades where
he lived, so one day he kidnapped Proserpine,
the lovely daughter of Ceres, and carried
her off to his kingdom. Now he came
riding along in what appeared to be that
same chariot drawn by spirited black horses.
By his side sat the sweet-faced Proserpine,
Queen of Hades, and at their feet lay Cerberus,
his pet dog, a monster with three
heads and a body covered with snakes in the
place of hair. On his head, Pluto wore a
magic helmet which gave him the power of
becoming invisible at will.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus they came, following each other in
one continuous line as far as the eye could
see.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Our young people watched them until the
last one had passed by, then they too passed
on, in search of other sights and scenes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>After the procession had passed, Mercury
turned and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well! What do you think of it for a
spectacular pageant?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think of it?” exclaimed Ione, “I never
even dreamed of anything so beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It even surpasses the royal elephant and
camel processions of Siam, in which all the
animals are caparisoned with gold and silver
and jewels. Until I had seen this wonderful
procession, I thought nothing could
surpass that,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You certainly have given us a treat,”
said the Prince and Harold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, I think you would enjoy boarding
a barge and taking a trip along the Milky
Way, visiting some of the strange countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that border it and inspecting some of the
palaces that line this silvery stream on
either side.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mercury went to procure a barge for them
and soon called to them to come down and
enter it. It was high at the back with a
raised divan shaded by silken curtains and
waving palms. The front was high and
pointed and stood well out of the stream of
sparkling stars beneath it. Its trimmings
were of purple and gold which fell over the
side in graceful festoons. There were seats
for six, two high carved chairs on the divan,
resembling seats on a royal throne, while the
others were beneath the three steps of the
raised platform.</p>

<p class='c009'>Harold and Ione insisted upon the Prince
and Princess occupying the elevated seats
and impersonating king and queen while
they would sit beneath them as their loyal
subjects, but the Prince and Princess would
not agree to this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But don’t you see,” urged Ione, “you
were to the purple born, while who ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>heard of a free-born American citizen occupying
a throne? Besides it would be too
quiet a proceeding for us and I am sure we
would jump up at the wrong time or upset a
chair during an audience if it proved too
tedious.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are mistaken,” said the Prince.
“You could rule by right of judgment and
strength while you would have me rule because
of the blood of my ancestors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mercury decide,” said the Princess.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very well,” he replied, “in that case I
think Harold and Ione should take the
chairs for we are their guests.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good for you, Mercury. You always
say the right thing at the right time,” said
the Prince.</p>

<p class='c009'>So Harold and Ione took the carved seats,
and for fun, wished they <i>were</i> a king and
queen, so when the Prince, Princess and
Mercury turned toward them, they were
speechless with surprise for a moment, for
instead of two plainly-dressed American
citizens, they saw two royal personages with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>golden myrtle crowns on their heads, flowing
robes of velvet, and ermine mantles upon
their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, I declare!” exclaimed the Prince.
“You two rival all the kings and queens I
ever saw for beauty and kingly bearing.
Where is your sceptre?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Harold held up a golden sceptre in the
shape of a wand.</p>

<p class='c009'>All this time they had been floating along
on this silent, silvery stream with its myriads
and myriads of silver stars, so tiny and
closely packed together that they looked like
molten silver.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first country at which they landed
was called The Land of Peace and Quietness.
Soft, gentle breezes blow across this
land, laden with the perfume of thousands
of flowers. No destroying electric storms
ever rage here to disturb the peaceful, quiet,
sunlit days. This is the land where the tired
people of Earth come to rest and have peace;
peace, everlasting peace, for those who
choose to stop. Here are those who have had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to battle with discord at home and rough
usage from the world at large and now all
they ask is to be let alone and to be allowed
to rest and wander through this blessed
country, drinking in and enjoying the beauties
and quiet of this blissful land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here the grass is always green, the hills
wrapped in purple mist over which float
snowy clouds lit by the sun, while all around
are shady groves filled with many birds that
trill and warble until it would seem as if
their little throats must burst with joyousness.
The silvery streams purr through the
grassy meadows, or sing a joyous song as
they tumble over the rocks down the mountain-side
or try to rival the lullaby of the
willow-boughs swaying to and fro above
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The flowers never die here but as fast as
one is plucked another blooms in its place.
No harsh, loud sounds are ever heard, only
harmony and melody float out on the air,
resting and strengthening the nerves of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>tired Earth people who come here for peace
and quiet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just over yonder mountains, further up
the stream, is the land called The Land of
Joy. Here everything is hustle and bustle,
laughter and fun, and wherever one goes he
meets picnic parties, some riding on hayracks,
others in pleasure-boats, while still
others roll by in open carriages. Brass
bands and dance music are heard in every
direction, a decided contrast to the soft,
plaintive music heard in the Land of Peace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here come the people who never had time
to enjoy themselves while upon Earth, but
who constantly longed to go to balls or picnics
in the country, the invalid sister of the
society girl or the poor seamstress who
spent her life sewing on the garments of her
more favored sisters. Every day with the
rising of the Sun, merry bells announce to
the inhabitants of this land that another day
for jolly good fun has commenced. Every
one on the streets is either whistling or singing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>too happy to walk sedately or to keep
silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is there no land of sorrow except
Hades?” asked Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” replied Mercury, “there is enough
sorrow on Earth to supply all the spheres
were it allowed to pass the air-shed line.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Along this stream you will find a land to
suit every body’s taste, be it a good one.
I think the land most thickly populated is
the Land of Music. Such halls and temples
you never beheld and all are filled with every
kind of musical instrument that was ever
invented, while all the choruses are heavenly
and harmonious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to travel farther or
would you prefer to visit some of the palaces
of the gods and goddesses?” asked Mercury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think we would like to explore that
castle set on yonder high cliff, that looks like
a castle on the Rhine, only a thousand times
more beautiful,” said Ione.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! that one belongs to Jupiter and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>always gives feasts when he returns from
his pilgrimage to Mount Olympus. Would
you like to return to the Land of Quietness
and Peace and wait until the day of the
feast and then attend it? You have been
traveling pretty fast and might like to rest,
or I should say change, for no one who possesses
a magic robe knows what fatigue is.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe that would be very pleasant,”
said Ione and they all returned to the Land
of Peace to wait for the feast. Here they
threw themselves in hammocks under the
shade of the trees, lazily listening the while
to the songs of the canaries and nightingales
overhead in the boughs. Were they hungry,
all they had to do was to wish for something
to eat and there spread beside them on a
pretty, rustic table was a repast, dainty
enough for an angel and substantial enough
for a king.</p>

<p class='c009'>They spent a day and night here and then
a swift messenger brought news that Jupiter
would not return to his castle for a week and
that the feast had been postponed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>When our travelers heard this they were
greatly disappointed but concluded not to
await his return.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning they again boarded the
barge and commenced floating down the
Milky Way, admiring the beautiful scenery
and castles that bordered its shores until
they came to its extreme northern limit,
when, chancing to look off toward the North
Star, they saw, shining with a splendor that
almost blinded them, what seemed to be a
colossal human eye surrounded by flashing
streamers of light that radiated from it in
all directions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it?” they all whispered in awe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may well ask,” said their guide.
“That is The All-Seeing Eye. It is placed
there to remind us that God is in all, through
all, and back of all these wonders we have
seen, and also to mark the limit to which a
human being may travel in this space. Thus
far and no farther can you go until you have
passed through the gate of death and become
immortal. And here,” continued Mercury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>rather sadly, “your journey in the clouds
must end. As a souvenir, you may keep the
acorns in which your robes were encased,
but the robes, I am sorry to say, you must
leave with me. I will conduct you to your
Elephant and see you safely started on your
return journey to Earth, and then I must
also return to my duties, for my life work is
not yet finished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When our friends at last commenced their
return trip to Earth, Mercury waved his
hands in adieu, and smiling and repeatedly
waving, gradually passed out of sight.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
